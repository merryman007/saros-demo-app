Welcome to Saros DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) - the engine that powers the Internet Financial Market on Solana. Think of it as the facilitator for all of your trades behind the scenes.
Instead of using complicated order books like traditional CEXs or slippage-bearing models of AMMs, Saros DLMM runs on Liquidity Book technology - with pools of tokens provided by users (like you!). These pools make it fast and seamless for anyone to trade directly on Solana - no middlemen, just pure DeFi power.
Liquidity is the foundation of financial markets. It ensures assets are tradable, capital can flow seamlessly, and markets remain functional. However, traditional financial systems are fragmented and inefficient. Each market - currencies, equities, or commodities - operates in isolation, tied to its own infrastructure, intermediaries, and rules. In these systems, liquidity is:
Not open - access is gated, participation is permissioned, and value is captured by intermediaries.
Not efficient - capital is fragmented, pricing is opaque, and value transfer is slow.
Not resilient - liquidity often disappears during market stress, precisely when it’s needed most.
In contrast, the Internet Financial Market demands liquidity that is:
Public - open to anyone, without gatekeepers.
Composable - interoperable with any application or market logic.
Resilient - always available, even in volatile conditions.
To achieve this, we need a liquidity primitive that is:
Automated - not provisioned manually by market makers
Onchain - enabled by smart contracts, not intermediaries.
Permissionless — open for anyone to use, supply, or build upon.
Composable — designed to integrate seamlessly into diverse systems.
That primitive already exists today: Automated Market Makers (AMMs).
AMMs collapse human coordination across the entire market-making stack - pricing engine, order book, and matching logic - into code. They eliminate the need for institutional liquidity providers, centralized listings, and siloed market infrastructure.
By turning liquidity into protocol, and exchange into code, AMMs become a new kind of market infrastructure - where liquidity is always-on, onchain, and open to anyone.
With AMMs:
Assets become tradable the moment they’re created.
Applications plug into shared liquidity, instead of bootstrapping their own.
Users connect directly to markets - no permission required.
This primitive transforms liquidity from a private service into a public good infrastructure. And when liquidity is treated as a public good, it becomes the foundation layer of the Internet Financial Market.
At the core of Saros DLMM is a next-generation AMM primitive: Liquidity Book. It is designed to make liquidity capital-efficient, composable, and resilient by default across a wider range of assets, market conditions, and use cases.
Key Features of DLMM:
Capital-efficient by design
Liquidity is deployed across discrete price bins, dynamically optimized for volatility, slippage, and fee capture - enabling deeper markets with less capital.
Composable by default
Liquidity is accessible at the protocol level - it can be routed, abstracted, borrowed, and integrated into any application.
Instant to launch
Any asset can launch instantly - no listing process and no integration bottlenecks. Liquidity is programmable from day one.
Built for volatility
DLMM is engineered to hold up under pressure. It rebalances dynamically, preserves depth, and keeps markets functional when they’re needed most.
Use Cases
Saros DLMM is a general-purpose liquidity engine designed to power programmable liquidity across a wide range of markets, including:
Spot markets
Lending
Stablecoins
Real-world assets (RWAs)
Forex
Derivatives and more
As more assets and applications integrate with Saros DLMM, the system compounds its value:
More assets → deeper liquidity → better execution → more yields (fees) → more liquidity providers (LPs) → more integrations.
This is how liquidity transformed from a fragmented service into shared, permissionless infrastructure that works for any asset, across any financial market.
And it starts with our liquidity book protocol.

Let's say Clark has a good $1,000 initial investment. An investment product offered him 6% interest every 6-month.Without compound impacts, the product's APR = 12% with a simple formula: 6% x 2 halves of the year = 12%.
Clark will receive a nice $1,000 x 12% = $120 return for his investment with APR = 12%With compound impacts, it gets trickier. For the first half of the year, Clark receives $1,000 x 6% = $60, which later gets reinvested, making the principal bigger at $1,060.
At the end of the year, Clark receives $1,060 x 6% = $63.6. Totally, Clark’s annual return is $60 + $63.6 = $123.6. This amount constitutes an APY = 12.36% to the principal $1,000.
An easier way to calculate APY is using the formula:APY = (1 + R/N)^N - 1Whereas R is the annual rate of return, N is the number of compounding periods.It can be clearly seen that APY is higher in comparison to APR due to compounding impacts.Why do we use APR on Saros?It is noticeable that all Stake & Farm pools on Saros use APR as the main interest metrics.Well, from our point of view, the simpler, the better. A display of extremely high APY can be a double-edged sword, giving a false assumption of the pool.Why does APR on Saros change all the time?Simple rule: The more users stake their tokens in Farms, the lower the incentives will be, thus APR & APY will be lowered. The same principle applied to the other way around.As the deposited amount changes from time to time, the APR will change accordingly.Why my rewards seem to be lower than UI APR?Currently APRs on Saros are calculated based on standard EPOCH of Solana network. However, in reality, Solana blocks do not run exactly in rhythm with the standard. Instead, they usually run slower, which means that it will take longer to reach destined block of each farm/stake pool.This explains why you feel like the actual reward being smaller than UI APR. In fact, the APR is still correct to Solana standard, but it will take a bit longer to reach full amount as Solana is running slower than the standard speed.PreviousHow to resolve the "No wallet" error when connecting wallet to Saros FinanceNextHow to get farming pool TxidLast updated3 years ago

On this pageThe difference between APY and APRWhy do we use APR on Saros?Why does APR on Saros change all the time?Why my rewards seem to be lower than UI APR?CopySAROS AMMFAQsWhat is the difference between APY and APR?You may have heard of APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and APR (Annual Percentage Rate), two of the most widely-recognized terms in crypto.Both APY and APR are used to calculate interest on investment; however, having deep-understandings on how they work and differ from each other would significantly affect how much you will earn with your crypto assets.The difference between APY and APRHere is a cheat sheet about APY/APR and their main differences:APYAnnual Percentage YieldAPRAnnual Percentage RateDefinitionAnnual rate of return considering compound interestAnnual rate of returnwithoutconsidering compound interestFactorsReturn depends on initial investmentandnumber of compounding periodsReturn depends on initial investment onlyFiguresAPY is higher due to compounding impactsWithout compounding impacts, APR is lower than APYAll these texts would be worthless without a good example. Let's say Clark has a good $1,000 initial investment. An investment product offered him 6% interest every 6-month.Without compound impacts, the product's APR = 12% with a simple formula: 6% x 2 halves of the year = 12%.
Clark will receive a nice $1,000 x 12% = $120 return for his investment with APR = 12%With compound impacts, it gets trickier. For the first half of the year, Clark receives $1,000 x 6% = $60, which later gets reinvested, making the principal bigger at $1,060.
At the end of the year, Clark receives $1,060 x 6% = $63.6. Totally, Clark’s annual return is $60 + $63.6 = $123.6. This amount constitutes an APY = 12.36% to the principal $1,000.
An easier way to calculate APY is using the formula:APY = (1 + R/N)^N - 1Whereas R is the annual rate of return, N is the number of compounding periods.It can be clearly seen that APY is higher in comparison to APR due to compounding impacts.Why do we use APR on Saros?It is noticeable that all Stake & Farm pools on Saros use APR as the main interest metrics.Well, from our point of view, the simpler, the better. A display of extremely high APY can be a double-edged sword, giving a false assumption of the pool.Why does APR on Saros change all the time?Simple rule: The more users stake their tokens in Farms, the lower the incentives will be, thus APR & APY will be lowered. The same principle applied to the other way around.As the deposited amount changes from time to time, the APR will change accordingly.Why my rewards seem to be lower than UI APR?Currently APRs on Saros are calculated based on standard EPOCH of Solana network. However, in reality, Solana blocks do not run exactly in rhythm with the standard. Instead, they usually run slower, which means that it will take longer to reach destined block of each farm/stake pool.This explains why you feel like the actual reward being smaller than UI APR. In fact, the APR is still correct to Solana standard, but it will take a bit longer to reach full amount as Solana is running slower than the standard speed.PreviousHow to resolve the "No wallet" error when connecting wallet to Saros FinanceNextHow to get farming pool TxidLast updated3 years ago

Please reduce the token amount (should be smaller a little bit than the quantity you are having in the account) or deposit more coins/ tokens to the wallet.Trading tokens with an insufficient balance of the gas fee=> Users don’t have SOL on Solana Wallet to pay for the gas fee or the amount of SOL is not enough to conduct a swapping order. Although SarosSwap has integrated the gas fee optimization mechanism but swapping via AMM goes through many routes and costs a lot of fees. So remember to save yourself a decent amount of this coin/token to avoid interrupting your transaction.Trading tokens with the too low gas fee=> Low gas fee leads to slow network and time-out. Also, transaction fees can be unexpectedly high when the network is congested. If you have approved your transaction but still fail, you just need to swap with the same amount of token again without spending any extra approval fee. Users should refer to the average transaction fees on blockchain explorers to adjust the reasonable gas fee.Trading tokens with low liquidity or during a volatile market=> The tokens you're trying to swap are probably small-cap tokens that few people are trading or you're trying to buy or sell tokens during a big price movement. Although the default Slippage on SarosSwap is set at the standard rate of 0.5%, which is quite safe and applicable to most coins on the market, in the case of volatile markets or low-liquidity pools, users can complete the transactions faster and avoid failures by accepting a higher slippage and slippage tolerance percentage.Note:You can check your transaction status onhttps://solscan.io/Avoid trading when the market has major fluctuations.PreviousIs Saros safe?

These fees are instantly accrued and compounded into your position with no manual claiming required. It's a smooth, hands-free way to grow your earnings.When and how to adjust your positionsTo keep earning trading fees, liquidity providers must rebalance their positions when their liquidity falls outside the active range. This involves removing tokens from inactive bins and redeploying them into active bins that reflect the current market price. Saros DLMM simplifies this process by offering flexible options so you can either add to your existing position or withdraw and redeploy some or all of your liquidity with ease.What are some considerations when re-balancing?Costs: Rebalancing requires gas fees and may involve trading between assets, which can incur additional fees. It's important to weigh these costs when deciding how often to rebalance your position.Market Conditions: Effective rebalancing on Saros DLMM depends on the market environment. In volatile conditions, more frequent rebalancing may be necessary to stay within the active range and maximize fee earnings.Deploy Liquidity in 5 Simple StepsAdd liquidity in just five easy steps or keep scrolling for the detailed walkthrough.Adding Liquidity: Step by Step GuideSelect a Liquidity Pool:On the Pools page, search for the pool you want to provide liquidity to.Deposit Your Token:Use the panel on the right side of the pool page to enter the amount of tokens you'd like to deposit. For example, you can add SAROS and SOL.Choose a Liquidity Shape:Select the liquidity shape that matches your strategy. If you're unsure, refer to the guide for help choosing the right option.Supply Liquidity:Click the "Supply" button to confirm your deposit. Afterward, your liquidity details will be shown on the left side of the screen. Your selected liquidity shape will appear in the graph, and your balance will be updated accordingly.Batch Liquidity DeploymentDeploy liquidity across ANY price range you choose. Simply select your preferred liquidity shape, input the desired price range, and use the 'Add Liquidity' option for each batch transaction.With Batch Liquidity Deployment, you can spread your liquidity across a wider range — perfect for a more passive and diversified liquidity provisioning strategy.Removing LiquidityHow to Remove Liquidity: 3 Flexible OptionsRemove both tokens from the poolRemove only the first tokenRemove only the second tokenTo remove liquidity, go to the Pool page where you've provided liquidity and click "Remove Liquidity." You'll be presented with three standard options — choose the one that suits your needs and set the amount you want to withdraw (or select "Remove All" for a full exit).Option 1:Remove both tokens from the poolOption 2:Remove only the first/ second tokenIf you'd like to remove tokens from specific bins, simply input the price ranges you want to target. This advanced option gives you more control and can be useful when rebalancing your position.Risks of Managing LiquidityParticipating as a liquidity provider on the Saros DLMM protocol involves several risks, including but not limited to: impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities, systemic failures, liquidity shortages, regulatory shifts, market volatility, and operational errors. Your capital is at risk, and you should only invest funds you can afford to lose. There are no guarantees of returns, and all investment decisions are made at your own discretion. We strongly recommend seeking independent financial advice before participating.PreviousSaros DLMM: IntroductionNextPermissionless Saros DLMM PoolsLast updated1 day ago

Removing your liquidity
When you provide liquidity with Saros DLMM, you automatically earn a share of the fees from every swap. These fees are instantly accrued and compounded into your position with no manual claiming required. It's a smooth, hands-free way to grow your earnings.
To keep earning trading fees, liquidity providers must rebalance their positions when their liquidity falls outside the active range. This involves removing tokens from inactive bins and redeploying them into active bins that reflect the current market price. Saros DLMM simplifies this process by offering flexible options so you can either add to your existing position or withdraw and redeploy some or all of your liquidity with ease.
Costs: Rebalancing requires gas fees and may involve trading between assets, which can incur additional fees. It's important to weigh these costs when deciding how often to rebalance your position.
Market Conditions: Effective rebalancing on Saros DLMM depends on the market environment. In volatile conditions, more frequent rebalancing may be necessary to stay within the active range and maximize fee earnings.
Add liquidity in just five easy steps or keep scrolling for the detailed walkthrough.
Select a Liquidity Pool:On the Pools page, search for the pool you want to provide liquidity to.
Deposit Your Token:Use the panel on the right side of the pool page to enter the amount of tokens you'd like to deposit. For example, you can add SAROS and SOL.
Choose a Liquidity Shape:Select the liquidity shape that matches your strategy. If you're unsure, refer to the guide for help choosing the right option.
Supply Liquidity:Click the "Supply" button to confirm your deposit. Afterward, your liquidity details will be shown on the left side of the screen. Your selected liquidity shape will appear in the graph, and your balance will be updated accordingly.
Deploy liquidity across ANY price range you choose. Simply select your preferred liquidity shape, input the desired price range, and use the 'Add Liquidity' option for each batch transaction.
With Batch Liquidity Deployment, you can spread your liquidity across a wider range — perfect for a more passive and diversified liquidity provisioning strategy.
How to Remove Liquidity: 3 Flexible Options
Remove both tokens from the pool
Remove only the first token
Remove only the second token
To remove liquidity, go to the Pool page where you've provided liquidity and click "Remove Liquidity." You'll be presented with three standard options — choose the one that suits your needs and set the amount you want to withdraw (or select "Remove All" for a full exit).Option 1:Remove both tokens from the pool
Option 2:Remove only the first/ second token
If you'd like to remove tokens from specific bins, simply input the price ranges you want to target. This advanced option gives you more control and can be useful when rebalancing your position.
Participating as a liquidity provider on the Saros DLMM protocol involves several risks, including but not limited to: impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities, systemic failures, liquidity shortages, regulatory shifts, market volatility, and operational errors. Your capital is at risk, and you should only invest funds you can afford to lose. There are no guarantees of returns, and all investment decisions are made at your own discretion.

V1 vs. V2: What’s the Difference?
V1: Traditional Constant Product Pool (x*y=k)
Maintains a 50/50 balance of both tokens across a full price curve from $0 to ∞.
Ideal for new token listings on the DEX.
Automatically balances your assets — good for set-it-and-forget-it liquidity.
V2: Saros DLMM Pool
Allows concentrated liquidity: provide liquidity only within specific price ranges.
Significantly increases capital efficiency, but also comes with more risk and responsibility.
Requires active liquidity management to stay within range.
When creating a V2 pool, you’ll need to:
Select Base and Quote AssetsBase Asset (Token X): The token being priced. Can be any token.Quote Asset (Token Y): The token used to define the price, limited to major tokens like AVAX, ETH, or USDC for optimal routing and liquidity.

Set Your Bin Step (Bps)
Bins are individual price points where liquidity is concentrated.
Bin Step (Bps) defines the price gap between each bin.
Understanding Bin Steps (Bps)
Each pool is made of bins — think of them as containers holding liquidity at fixed prices. The Bin Step determines how wide or narrow the price gaps are between bins:
Example:
20 bps (0.2%)ARB/USDC Bin 1: $1.21464ARB/USDC Bin 2: $1.21707
20 bps (0.2%)
ARB/USDC Bin 1: $1.21464
ARB/USDC Bin 2: $1.21707
100 bps (0.8%) over 20 bins covers a 22% price range
20 bps (0.2%) over 20 bins covers only a 4% price range
For new tokens, a higher Bin Step (wider price gaps) may simplify liquidity management and reduce the need for frequent rebalancing.
Before launching:
Set the Active Market Price
This is crucial — the price you enter will be the starting point for the pool.
✅ Ensure it reflects the actual market price of the asset.
❌ Entering the wrong price can lead to arbitrage losses and unrecoverable funds.

Let's delve into some of its standout features:Concentrated Liquidity:Enhance Your Capital UtilizationSurge Pricing:Liquidity Providers earn moreBin Architecture:Flexible Liquidity ManagementZero-slippage Swaps:Get the best trading rates for traders.Concentrated LiquidityUnlike traditional AMMs that distribute liquidity across broad price ranges, Saros DLMM enables providers to concentrate capital within targeted price bands. This boosts capital efficiency, allowing for larger trades with reduced slippage. As a result, traders benefit from more stable pricing, while liquidity providers can earn higher fees.Surge PricingSaros DLMM features a dynamic surge pricing model that adjusts swap fees in real-time based on market volatility. During periods of high price fluctuation, trading fees increase slightly and disincentivize excessive trading while liquidity providers are compensated with higher returns, helping to mitigate risks such as impermanent loss and incentivizing deeper liquidity provisioning when it’s most needed.Bin ArchitectureSaros DLMM introduces a unique bin-based system, where liquidity is divided into discrete pools at fixed price levels. Each bin represents liquidity at a specific price point, and together, they form a full liquidity pool. This structure minimizes price impact during trades, leading to better execution for traders. For liquidity providers, it enables precise, strategy-driven fund allocation and maximizing returns by aligning with market movements.Zero Slippage SwapsIn traditional AMMs, asset prices shift based on pool composition — each trade alters the ratio, causing price movement. As a result, buyers push prices up and sellers push them down, leading to slippage — where the final trade price differs from the quoted one.With Saros DLMM’s bin architecture, swaps are executed at fixed price levels, enablingzero slippage. This means the price you see is the price you get, allowing for more accurate, efficient, and predictable trading.PreviousOnboarding and GuidesNextLiquidity Lifecycle: Deployment, Management & RebalancingLast updated4 months ago

Operational RiskWhat is Divergence Loss (Impermanent Loss)?Scenario 1: Price of Token A increases to $200 (Token B stays $1)Scenario 2: Price of Token A drops to $50 (Token B stays $1)CopySAROS DLMMOnboarding and GuidesUnderstanding Your Risks as a Liquidity Provider on Saros DLMMUnderstanding Your Risks as a Liquidity Provider on Saros DLMMProviding liquidity in DeFi opens the door to earning trading fees and incentives — but like any financial strategy, it also comes with risks.At Saros, we want to help you make informed decisions. This guide breaks down the main risks you should understand before depositing liquidity into Saros DLMM pools.1. Impermanent Loss (IL)Impermanent loss occurs when the market price of the tokens in your pool moves away from your entry price. If you withdraw your liquidity after a major price shift, the value of your assets may be less than if you just held them.It’s called “impermanent” because it only becomes real if you withdraw while prices are still misaligned.IL can be minimized (or even reversed) if prices return to your original range — or if fees earned compensate for the divergence.Bin-based liquidity allows you to target specific price zones, which can help reduce exposure to IL — but it doesn't eliminate it completely.2. Out-of-Range LiquidityIf the market moves outside the price range where your liquidity is placed, your position becomes inactive and stops earning fees.You’ll need to:Wait for the price to come back into range,orReposition your liquidity to the new active price binsThis creates a balance between passive vs. active management — tighter ranges earn more but need more maintenance.3. Price VolatilityDeFi markets can move fast, and tokens can be highly volatile. While this can increase trading volume (and fees), it also increases exposure to:Impermanent lossSudden market swingsPool imbalanceAs an LP, you're indirectly taking on price exposure, especially if you're concentrated in a small range or single-sided.4. Smart Contract RiskSaros DLMM is a smart contract system. While it's designed for security and efficiency,no smart contract is risk-free.Potential risks include:Bugs in the contract codeExploits or vulnerabilitiesIntegration errors with third-party platformsAlways ensure you’re usingverified contractsandofficial interfaces(like Saros’ dApp), and keep your wallet software updated.5. Protocol-Level RisksEven if the contracts are safe, risks may arise at the protocol level:Misconfigured incentivesGovernance attacksLiquidity migration eventsDependency risks (e.g., price oracles, bridges)These can affect how rewards are distributed or how pools behave, especially in turbulent market conditions.6. Regulatory UncertaintyWhile DeFi is global and open, regulatory changes in your country (or globally) may impact your ability to participate or affect how protocols operate in the future.Stay informed and aware of local legal frameworks — especially when dealing with real-world assets or stablecoins.7. Operational RiskSometimes, simple user-side errors can cause problems:Depositing into the wrong pool or rangeMistiming entry during high volatilityForgetting to manage or withdraw liquidityWe recommend all usersreview their positions regularlyand use Saros’ UI features likeMy Positions,Real-Time Rewards, andLimit Ordersfor better control.What is Divergence Loss (Impermanent Loss)?Impermanent loss happens when the price of tokens in a liquidity pool moves away from the point where you deposited liquidity. It’s “impermanent” because the loss is only realized when you withdraw — but with concentrated liquidity (like on Saros), the impact can be more noticeable if you're tightly positioned.Setup:Let’s say:Token A = $100Token B = $1You provide $1000 in liquidity as5 Token A + 500 Token BYour liquidity is placed in atight range(e.g., $99.9 to $100.1)Scenario 1: Price of Token A increases to $200 (Token B stays $1)StrategyToken AToken BTotal ValueImpermanent LossHolding5500$15000%Saros AMM3.54707.11$1414.215.7%Saros DLMM01000$100033.3%Because you were in a concentrated range and didn’t adjust, all of your Token A got swapped into Token B before the price pumped → lower ending value.Scenario 2: Price of Token A drops to $50 (Token B stays $1)StrategyToken AToken BTotal ValueImpermanent LossHolding5500$7500%Saros AMM7.07353.55$707.115.7%Saros DLMM100$50033.3%This time, your entire position got swapped into Token A as the price dropped. If you withdraw now, you lock in a lower value than if you had simply held both tokens.Key TakeawaysConcentrated Liquidity = Higher Risk, Higher RewardYou can earn more fees, but you’re also more exposed to price divergence;Wider ranges reduce divergence loss, but they may earn fewer fees;Active LPs should monitor positions and rebalancewhen the price leaves the active range.PreviousPermissionless Saros DLMM PoolsNextShapes and StrategiesLast updated4 months ago

This guide breaks down the main risks you should understand before depositing liquidity into Saros DLMM pools.1. Impermanent Loss (IL)Impermanent loss occurs when the market price of the tokens in your pool moves away from your entry price. If you withdraw your liquidity after a major price shift, the value of your assets may be less than if you just held them.It’s called “impermanent” because it only becomes real if you withdraw while prices are still misaligned.IL can be minimized (or even reversed) if prices return to your original range — or if fees earned compensate for the divergence.Bin-based liquidity allows you to target specific price zones, which can help reduce exposure to IL — but it doesn't eliminate it completely.2. Out-of-Range LiquidityIf the market moves outside the price range where your liquidity is placed, your position becomes inactive and stops earning fees.You’ll need to:Wait for the price to come back into range,orReposition your liquidity to the new active price binsThis creates a balance between passive vs. active management — tighter ranges earn more but need more maintenance.3. Price VolatilityDeFi markets can move fast, and tokens can be highly volatile. While this can increase trading volume (and fees), it also increases exposure to:Impermanent lossSudden market swingsPool imbalanceAs an LP, you're indirectly taking on price exposure, especially if you're concentrated in a small range or single-sided.4. Smart Contract RiskSaros DLMM is a smart contract system. While it's designed for security and efficiency,no smart contract is risk-free.Potential risks include:Bugs in the contract codeExploits or vulnerabilitiesIntegration errors with third-party platformsAlways ensure you’re usingverified contractsandofficial interfaces(like Saros’ dApp), and keep your wallet software updated.5. Protocol-Level RisksEven if the contracts are safe, risks may arise at the protocol level:Misconfigured incentivesGovernance attacksLiquidity migration eventsDependency risks (e.g., price oracles, bridges)These can affect how rewards are distributed or how pools behave, especially in turbulent market conditions.6. Regulatory UncertaintyWhile DeFi is global and open, regulatory changes in your country (or globally) may impact your ability to participate or affect how protocols operate in the future.Stay informed and aware of local legal frameworks — especially when dealing with real-world assets or stablecoins.7. Operational RiskSometimes, simple user-side errors can cause problems:Depositing into the wrong pool or rangeMistiming entry during high volatilityForgetting to manage or withdraw liquidityWe recommend all usersreview their positions regularlyand use Saros’ UI features likeMy Positions,Real-Time Rewards, andLimit Ordersfor better control.What is Divergence Loss (Impermanent Loss)?Impermanent loss happens when the price of tokens in a liquidity pool moves away from the point where you deposited liquidity.

Providing liquidity in DeFi opens the door to earning trading fees and incentives — but like any financial strategy, it also comes with risks.
At Saros, we want to help you make informed decisions. This guide breaks down the main risks you should understand before depositing liquidity into Saros DLMM pools.
Impermanent loss occurs when the market price of the tokens in your pool moves away from your entry price. If you withdraw your liquidity after a major price shift, the value of your assets may be less than if you just held them.
It’s called “impermanent” because it only becomes real if you withdraw while prices are still misaligned.
IL can be minimized (or even reversed) if prices return to your original range — or if fees earned compensate for the divergence.
Bin-based liquidity allows you to target specific price zones, which can help reduce exposure to IL — but it doesn't eliminate it completely.
If the market moves outside the price range where your liquidity is placed, your position becomes inactive and stops earning fees.
You’ll need to:
Wait for the price to come back into range,or
Reposition your liquidity to the new active price bins
This creates a balance between passive vs. active management — tighter ranges earn more but need more maintenance.
DeFi markets can move fast, and tokens can be highly volatile. While this can increase trading volume (and fees), it also increases exposure to:
Impermanent loss
Sudden market swings
Pool imbalance
As an LP, you're indirectly taking on price exposure, especially if you're concentrated in a small range or single-sided.
Saros DLMM is a smart contract system. While it's designed for security and efficiency,no smart contract is risk-free.
Potential risks include:
Bugs in the contract code
Exploits or vulnerabilities
Integration errors with third-party platforms
Always ensure you’re usingverified contractsandofficial interfaces(like Saros’ dApp), and keep your wallet software updated.
Even if the contracts are safe, risks may arise at the protocol level:
Misconfigured incentives
Governance attacks
Liquidity migration events
Dependency risks (e.g., price oracles, bridges)
These can affect how rewards are distributed or how pools behave, especially in turbulent market conditions.
While DeFi is global and open, regulatory changes in your country (or globally) may impact your ability to participate or affect how protocols operate in the future.
Stay informed and aware of local legal frameworks — especially when dealing with real-world assets or stablecoins.
Sometimes, simple user-side errors can cause problems:
Depositing into the wrong pool or range
Mistiming entry during high volatility
Forgetting to manage or withdraw liquidity
We recommend all usersreview their positions regularlyand use Saros’ UI features likeMy Positions,Real-Time Rewards, andLimit Ordersfor better control.
Impermanent loss happens when the price of tokens in a liquidity pool moves away from the point where you deposited liquidity. It’s “impermanent” because the loss is only realized when you withdraw — but with concentrated liquidity (like on Saros), the impact can be more noticeable if you're tightly positioned.
Setup:
Let’s say:
Token A = $100
Token B = $1
You provide $1000 in liquidity as5 Token A + 500 Token B
Your liquidity is placed in atight range(e.g., $99.9 to $100.1)

Improved Liquidity DepthHow to Start Earning with CI on SarosStep 1: Find a Rewarded PoolStep 2: Check Reward InfoStep 3: Deploy LiquidityStep 4: Start EarningPro Tips for Maximizing CICopySAROS DLMMRewardsConcentrated Incentives (CI) on SarosEarn real-time, on-chain rewards by actively managing your liquidity.Concentrated Incentives (CI) is Saros' reward mechanism designed for Saros DLMM Pools. Unlike traditional yield farming or retroactive reward systems, CI enables you to earn rewards instantly and on-chain when your liquidity is within a specified reward zone.This model blends the familiarity of AMM’s yield farming with the precision of concentrated liquidity, offering smarter, more active ways to earn.What Are Concentrated Incentives?Concentrated Incentives are real-time incentives distributed to Liquidity Providers (LPs) who actively position their liquidity inside thereward range— a zone around the current market price (called the active bin). As the price changes, the reward range moves with it, encouraging LPs to stay aligned with the market.Key differences from traditional rewards programs:No waiting:Rewards are distributed continuously, without delayFully onchain:Transparent, permissionless, and auditableMarket-aligned:Designed to support liquidity depth at the current priceHow Does CI Work?Each Saros DLMM Pool has areward range, defined as a number of bins (price intervals) around theactive bin. This range usually spans between1 and 11 bins, depending on the pool.If you deploy liquidity within that range, you’ll receive a share of the pool’s rewards —proportional to how much liquidityyou contributewithin the reward zone.Example:You provide50% of the liquidityin the reward range → you receive50% of the rewardsYou provide20% of the liquidity→ you receive20% of the rewardsAs the active bin shifts due to price movements, the reward range also shifts. This real-time rebalancing incentivizes LPs to stay close to the market price, improving efficiency and slippage for traders.Why CI MattersCI creates adynamic incentive structurethat rewards LPs not just for supplying capital, but for placing itwhere it matters most: around the price users are actually trading at.This leads to:Better pricingMore efficient swapsDeeper liquidity at active pricesBetter capital utilization for LPsKey Benefits of Concentrated Incentives1. Real-Time RewardsNo waiting for a weekly or monthly distribution — your liquidity starts earning instantly if it’s in range.2. Adaptive to Price MovementsThe reward zone follows the market, encouraging LPs to adjust and stay competitive.3.

Earn real-time, on-chain rewards by actively managing your liquidity.
Concentrated Incentives (CI) is Saros' reward mechanism designed for Saros DLMM Pools. Unlike traditional yield farming or retroactive reward systems, CI enables you to earn rewards instantly and on-chain when your liquidity is within a specified reward zone.
This model blends the familiarity of AMM’s yield farming with the precision of concentrated liquidity, offering smarter, more active ways to earn.
Concentrated Incentives are real-time incentives distributed to Liquidity Providers (LPs) who actively position their liquidity inside thereward range— a zone around the current market price (called the active bin). As the price changes, the reward range moves with it, encouraging LPs to stay aligned with the market.
Key differences from traditional rewards programs:
No waiting:Rewards are distributed continuously, without delay
Fully onchain:Transparent, permissionless, and auditable
Market-aligned:Designed to support liquidity depth at the current price
Each Saros DLMM Pool has areward range, defined as a number of bins (price intervals) around theactive bin. This range usually spans between1 and 11 bins, depending on the pool.
If you deploy liquidity within that range, you’ll receive a share of the pool’s rewards —proportional to how much liquidityyou contributewithin the reward zone.
You provide50% of the liquidityin the reward range → you receive50% of the rewards
You provide20% of the liquidity→ you receive20% of the rewards
As the active bin shifts due to price movements, the reward range also shifts. This real-time rebalancing incentivizes LPs to stay close to the market price, improving efficiency and slippage for traders.
CI creates adynamic incentive structurethat rewards LPs not just for supplying capital, but for placing itwhere it matters most: around the price users are actually trading at.
This leads to:
Better pricing
More efficient swaps
Deeper liquidity at active prices
Better capital utilization for LPs
No waiting for a weekly or monthly distribution — your liquidity starts earning instantly if it’s in range.
The reward zone follows the market, encouraging LPs to adjust and stay competitive.
Each Liquidity Pool can define its own reward range, allowing tailored incentives to suit different trading pairs or market conditions.
By encouraging liquidity at the current price, CI helps reduce slippage and create better trading experiences for users.
Here’s how to get started in just a few steps:
Head to thePoolssection on Saros. Look for aLiquidity Book (LB) Poolthat has a“Rewards”tag.
On the pool page, you’ll see:
The size of the reward range (number of bins)
The estimated APR
Total liquidity in the range
Your potential share if you add liquidity
You can deposit within the reward range or over a broader range that includes it. Your strategy depends on how actively you want to manage your liquidity.
For passive LPs, covering the range gives flexibility. For active LPs, focusing tightly on the reward bins may offer higher yields.
Once your liquidity is deployed:
You immediately begin earning proportional rewards
The active reward bins will be highlighted in the "My Liquidity" section
You can track what portion of your position is earning rewards in real time
Use tighter ranges if you're actively managing liquidity
Adjust your positions when the market moves — the reward range moves with the price
Monitor your bins in the dashboard and consider automating rebalancing with future tools or bots

This method suits users who treat liquidity as a dynamic trading tool rather than a passive income stream.You define price ranges, set the distribution, and let the Shape structure handle the execution.Strategy 2: Peg Divergence OpportunitiesWhen stablecoins drift from their intended peg, Saros lets you capture that volatility. By placing liquidity slightly above and below the peg, you can earn fees while others wait for the market to rebalance.This approach works whether you're anticipating a temporary misalignment or simply want to stay exposed to short-term volatility.Strategy 3: DCA-Integrated LiquiditySaros Shapes support strategies that combine Dollar Cost Averaging with fee generation. For example, you can structure wide-range liquidity to earn fees while limit orders wait at lower levels to buy dips.This is ideal for long-term participants who want both exposure and efficient capital usage over time.Strategy 4: Smart Entry & ExitLooking to buy or sell large amounts over time without slippage? You can use Curve or Bid-Ask shapes that allow liquidity to gradually fill your orders at optimal prices.Want even more control? Convert the Shape to a limit order, so once your target price hits, the position exits automatically.Strategy 5: Liquidity WallsUse one-sided Spot Shapes to set up strong liquidity zones — either as buy walls (support) or sell walls (resistance). These can be tactical points where you accumulate fees or place directional bets.Protocols can also use this structure to create automated buyback zones and price floors for their tokens, adding stability to the market.Understanding the RisksParticipating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices divergeSmart contract vulnerabilitiesSystemic or platform-related failuresMarket volatility and liquidity crunchesRegulatory shifts
Human or operational errorsThere are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose.

It distributes your liquidity uniformly across a specified price range, making it versatile and relatively straightforward to manage. This uniform structure is especially effective for adapting to different asset types and market conditions, providing balanced exposure and predictable fee generation.Let’s explore how Spot can be applied in different configurations to suit various goals, from high capital efficiency to low-maintenance setups.Spot Strategies: From Precision to PassiveSpot: Concentrated – High Reward, High RiskThis strategy is tailored for experienced liquidity providers who want to optimize capital efficiency by focusing all liquidity within a narrow price band—typically one to three bins. While this can lead to high fee generation, especially in stablecoin pairs, it also exposes providers to a greater risk of impermanent loss (IL) and requires frequent rebalancing to stay within range.Ideal for:Stablecoin-to-stablecoin pairsShort-term, high-volume trading periodsAdvanced users comfortable with riskSpot: Wide – Balanced Exposure for BeginnersThe Wide configuration spreads liquidity over a broader range (roughly 20 to 50 bins), reducing the risk of being priced out of the market and lessening the need for frequent adjustments. It’s a great choice for those newer to the Saros DLMM system or anyone who prefers checking in on their position every few days rather than daily.Key benefits:Captures volatility-driven feesLess rebalancing requiredSuitable for more volatile assetsSpot: Ultra Wide – Set It and Forget ItThe Ultra Wide shape is designed for minimal maintenance, making it ideal for users who prefer a passive approach. By distributing liquidity across hundreds of bins, it ensures continuous exposure regardless of price movement. This strategy mimics the traditional x*y=k model, familiar from legacy AMMs.Notable characteristics:Very low upkeepBest for long-term, low-effort strategiesLiquidity is deployed in multiple batches, each through a separate transaction.Curve Strategy: Smart Middle GroundFor those seeking a balance between tight concentration and wide coverage, the Curve shape is a solid choice. It focuses most of your liquidity around the current price while still spreading some to neighboring bins. This structure allows liquidity providers to benefit from price fluctuations without putting all their capital at immediate risk.Best suited for:Stable pairs with soft pegsKey support/resistance levels in volatile pairsUsers who don’t mind rebalancing but want diversified exposureBid-Ask Strategy: Volatility Hunters’ PlaygroundThe Bid-Ask shape is the most advanced among the basic strategies. It’s built to thrive in volatile markets by capturing movements around a target price. This structure splits liquidity across bid and ask levels to optimize for fee generation when prices swing within your chosen range.However, to remain effective, this strategy demands consistent monitoring and rebalancing. If the price exits your defined range or volatility dries up, adjustments are necessary.Choose this if you:Are experienced and comfortable managing complexityWant to capture profit from consistent market fluctuationsUnderstand the trade-offs between fee potential and riskUnderstanding the RisksParticipating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices divergeSmart contract vulnerabilitiesSystemic or platform-related failuresMarket volatility and liquidity crunchesRegulatory shiftsHuman or operational errorsThere are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose.

What You'll Learn:
Introduction to Spot Liquidity Shapes
Strategy Breakdown: Concentrated, Wide, and Ultra Wide
Curve and Bid-Ask Strategy Explained
Among the various liquidity provisioning methods, Spot stands out as the most accessible and widely used shape. It distributes your liquidity uniformly across a specified price range, making it versatile and relatively straightforward to manage. This uniform structure is especially effective for adapting to different asset types and market conditions, providing balanced exposure and predictable fee generation.
Let’s explore how Spot can be applied in different configurations to suit various goals, from high capital efficiency to low-maintenance setups.
This strategy is tailored for experienced liquidity providers who want to optimize capital efficiency by focusing all liquidity within a narrow price band—typically one to three bins. While this can lead to high fee generation, especially in stablecoin pairs, it also exposes providers to a greater risk of impermanent loss (IL) and requires frequent rebalancing to stay within range.
Ideal for:
Stablecoin-to-stablecoin pairs
Short-term, high-volume trading periods
Advanced users comfortable with risk
The Wide configuration spreads liquidity over a broader range (roughly 20 to 50 bins), reducing the risk of being priced out of the market and lessening the need for frequent adjustments. It’s a great choice for those newer to the Saros DLMM system or anyone who prefers checking in on their position every few days rather than daily.
Key benefits:
Captures volatility-driven fees
Less rebalancing required
Suitable for more volatile assets
The Ultra Wide shape is designed for minimal maintenance, making it ideal for users who prefer a passive approach. By distributing liquidity across hundreds of bins, it ensures continuous exposure regardless of price movement. This strategy mimics the traditional x*y=k model, familiar from legacy AMMs.
Notable characteristics:
Very low upkeep
Best for long-term, low-effort strategies
Liquidity is deployed in multiple batches, each through a separate transaction.
For those seeking a balance between tight concentration and wide coverage, the Curve shape is a solid choice. It focuses most of your liquidity around the current price while still spreading some to neighboring bins. This structure allows liquidity providers to benefit from price fluctuations without putting all their capital at immediate risk.
Best suited for:
Stable pairs with soft pegs
Key support/resistance levels in volatile pairs
Users who don’t mind rebalancing but want diversified exposure
The Bid-Ask shape is the most advanced among the basic strategies. It’s built to thrive in volatile markets by capturing movements around a target price. This structure splits liquidity across bid and ask levels to optimize for fee generation when prices swing within your chosen range.
However, to remain effective, this strategy demands consistent monitoring and rebalancing. If the price exits your defined range or volatility dries up, adjustments are necessary.
Choose this if you:
Are experienced and comfortable managing complexity
Want to capture profit from consistent market fluctuations
Understand the trade-offs between fee potential and risk
Participating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:
Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices diverge
Smart contract vulnerabilities
Systemic or platform-related failures
Market volatility and liquidity crunches
Regulatory shifts
Human or operational errors
There are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose. If you're unsure, always seek advice from a qualified financial professional.

Understanding the RisksCopySAROS DLMMShapes and StrategiesLiquidity ShapesWhat you’ll learn:Introduction to Liquidity ShapesSpotCurveBid-askHow to earn fees using a ShapeThe types of Shapes and StrategiesYour RisksI. Introduction to Liquidity ShapesThis guide is tailored to help you get the most out of the Saros DLMM as deployed on Saros DLMM. At the core of this system is the concept of Liquidity Shapes—customizable strategies that allow you to decide how and where your capital is allocated across different price points. This flexibility empowers your funds to work smarter, enabling you to optimize returns based on your personal strategy and market expectations.The secret behind Liquidity Shapes is the bin-based architecture. Unlike traditional AMMs, which spread your liquidity evenly, Saros DLMM lets you choose exactly where to place your funds by using "bins."“What is a bin?
A bin is a fixed-price segment in a Saros DLMM pool. Each bin corresponds to a specific price point. When you add liquidity to a bin, your funds are active only at that price level. Traders interact with your liquidity when the market trades within that bin's range—earning you fees in the process.”By combining and customizing bins, you create a Liquidity Shape that matches your market outlook, risk tolerance, and strategy. There’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach—each shape has its own strengths depending on how and when it’s used.Let’s explore the three core Liquidity Shapes:1.1 Spot ShapeStructure:Spot shape distributes liquidity uniformly across your selected price range. This means every price point within the range gets equal liquidity, offering a balanced, straightforward setup.Ideal For:Stable or low-volatility tokensTraders who expect the price to hover near a specific levelQuick, efficient trades at the market priceWhy Use It:It’s a reliable all-around option for maintaining consistent exposure across a range. Spot shape is simple yet effective, particularly when you want a passive strategy with even risk distribution.1.2 Curve ShapeStructure:Curve shape concentrates most of your liquidity around the central point of your range, gradually tapering off toward the edges. This forms a bell-curve-like distribution, maximizing capital efficiency near the expected price.Ideal For:Pairs with low to moderate volatilityLong-term liquidity providersSideways or range-bound marketsWhy Use It:Perfect for passive LPs looking to stay in-range longer while optimizing returns. Curve shape offers a smart balance between exposure and efficiency, reducing the need for frequent repositioning.1.3 Bid-Ask ShapeStructure:The Bid-Ask shape places liquidity at both ends of your selected range, leaving the middle relatively empty. It resembles an inverted curve or order book, focusing on price extremes.Ideal For:Volatile or swing-trading environmentsStable or pegged pairs with sudden deviationsTraders aiming to buy low and sell high over timeWhy Use It:This setup is tactical and reactive. By concentrating liquidity on the outer edges, it’s well-suited for earning fees during volatility or for gradually accumulating/distributing positions during swings.II. How to Earn FeesAs an LP, you earn trading fees when users swap tokens in the bins where your liquidity is active. The more trading activity in your bins, the more fees you collect. Here’s how to get the most from your liquidity:Stay in Active Bins: You only earn fees when trades occur in the bins you’ve chosen. Position your liquidity where trading volume is highest.Adjust with the Market: Markets shift—so should your strategy. Monitor your shapes and move them as needed to stay relevant.Match Shape to Conditions:Spot Shape for stable pricesCurve Shape for sideways or range-bound marketsBid-Ask Shape for high-volatility situationsWith Liquidity Shapes, you control where your funds are used—so you can focus your capital where it works hardest.III. The Types of Shapes and StrategiesWhether you’re just starting out or looking to fine-tune advanced strategies, Saros DLMM supports a wide range of liquidity deployments. Here's a breakdown:Basic StrategiesDesigned for ease-of-use, these are ideal for users who are new to Saros DLMM or concentrated liquidity:Passive Curve: A smooth distribution across a price range. Easy to set, low maintenance.Tight Spot: Narrow deployment around a stable price. Great for active monitoring.Entry/Exit Spot: Use a narrow shape to gradually buy or sell into a token.Advanced StrategiesFor more experienced users looking to customize deeply and control risk/reward:Split Shapes: Combine bid-side and ask-side liquidity to profit from price swings.Staggered Curves: Layered deployments for covering breakout zones.Automated Rebalancing: Use bots or external tools to adjust shapes in real time based on volatility or indicators.Single-Sided StrategiesTarget just one side of the market:Buy-side Liquidity: Accumulate a token when price dips.Sell-side Liquidity: Exit your position as the price increases.These are highly effective for efficient entries and exits—especially when paired with the right shape.IV. Understanding the RisksParticipating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices divergeSmart contract vulnerabilitiesSystemic or platform-related failuresMarket volatility and liquidity crunchesRegulatory shiftsHuman or operational errorsThere are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose.

The secret behind Liquidity Shapes is the bin-based architecture. Unlike traditional AMMs, which spread your liquidity evenly, Saros DLMM lets you choose exactly where to place your funds by using "bins."
“What is a bin?
A bin is a fixed-price segment in a Saros DLMM pool. Each bin corresponds to a specific price point. When you add liquidity to a bin, your funds are active only at that price level. Traders interact with your liquidity when the market trades within that bin's range—earning you fees in the process.”
By combining and customizing bins, you create a Liquidity Shape that matches your market outlook, risk tolerance, and strategy. There’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach—each shape has its own strengths depending on how and when it’s used.
Let’s explore the three core Liquidity Shapes:
1.1 Spot Shape
Structure:
Spot shape distributes liquidity uniformly across your selected price range. This means every price point within the range gets equal liquidity, offering a balanced, straightforward setup.
Ideal For:
Stable or low-volatility tokens
Traders who expect the price to hover near a specific level
Quick, efficient trades at the market price
Why Use It:
It’s a reliable all-around option for maintaining consistent exposure across a range. Spot shape is simple yet effective, particularly when you want a passive strategy with even risk distribution.
1.2 Curve Shape
Curve shape concentrates most of your liquidity around the central point of your range, gradually tapering off toward the edges. This forms a bell-curve-like distribution, maximizing capital efficiency near the expected price.
Pairs with low to moderate volatility
Long-term liquidity providers
Sideways or range-bound markets
Perfect for passive LPs looking to stay in-range longer while optimizing returns. Curve shape offers a smart balance between exposure and efficiency, reducing the need for frequent repositioning.
1.3 Bid-Ask Shape
The Bid-Ask shape places liquidity at both ends of your selected range, leaving the middle relatively empty. It resembles an inverted curve or order book, focusing on price extremes.
Volatile or swing-trading environments
Stable or pegged pairs with sudden deviations
Traders aiming to buy low and sell high over time
This setup is tactical and reactive. By concentrating liquidity on the outer edges, it’s well-suited for earning fees during volatility or for gradually accumulating/distributing positions during swings.
As an LP, you earn trading fees when users swap tokens in the bins where your liquidity is active. The more trading activity in your bins, the more fees you collect. Here’s how to get the most from your liquidity:
Stay in Active Bins: You only earn fees when trades occur in the bins you’ve chosen. Position your liquidity where trading volume is highest.
Adjust with the Market: Markets shift—so should your strategy. Monitor your shapes and move them as needed to stay relevant.
Match Shape to Conditions:Spot Shape for stable pricesCurve Shape for sideways or range-bound marketsBid-Ask Shape for high-volatility situations
Match Shape to Conditions:
Spot Shape for stable prices
Curve Shape for sideways or range-bound markets
Bid-Ask Shape for high-volatility situations
With Liquidity Shapes, you control where your funds are used—so you can focus your capital where it works hardest.
Whether you’re just starting out or looking to fine-tune advanced strategies, Saros DLMM supports a wide range of liquidity deployments. Here's a breakdown:
Designed for ease-of-use, these are ideal for users who are new to Saros DLMM or concentrated liquidity:
Passive Curve: A smooth distribution across a price range. Easy to set, low maintenance.
Tight Spot: Narrow deployment around a stable price. Great for active monitoring.
Entry/Exit Spot: Use a narrow shape to gradually buy or sell into a token.
For more experienced users looking to customize deeply and control risk/reward:
Split Shapes: Combine bid-side and ask-side liquidity to profit from price swings.
Staggered Curves: Layered deployments for covering breakout zones.
Automated Rebalancing: Use bots or external tools to adjust shapes in real time based on volatility or indicators.
Target just one side of the market:
Buy-side Liquidity: Accumulate a token when price dips.
Sell-side Liquidity: Exit your position as the price increases.
These are highly effective for efficient entries and exits—especially when paired with the right shape.
Participating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:
Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices diverge
Smart contract vulnerabilities
Systemic or platform-related failures
Market volatility and liquidity crunches
Regulatory shifts
Human or operational errors
There are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose. If you're unsure, always seek advice from a qualified financial professional.

To earn fees on Saros DLMM, your liquidity needs to be actively participating in trades — which only happens when it’s within the current price range, also known as the active bin. If the price moves outside your chosen range, your liquidity becomes inactive, and your position stops generating fees. This section covers how to identify that state and your options for responding.
The active bin represents the price range where trading is currently happening — and where your liquidity must be placed to earn fees. On the Saros UI, this bin is clearly visualized, helping you track if your liquidity is positioned correctly. If it is, your orders will appear as straddling the active bin.
When price moves and your liquidity falls outside of this bin, your position becomes inactive, meaning you no longer earn trading fees.
If the market price shifts beyond your selected liquidity range, your position is considered out of range. This means your liquidity is sitting idle, and the assets are no longer participating in swaps.
You’ll know your position is out of range via clear UI indicators — all of your shapes will appear in a single color (e.g., green or purple), showing they’re no longer straddling the current trading range.
Here are scenarios that explore the possible actions an LP might consider when remedy an out of position range:
Scenario:
Let’s say you’re a liquidity provider on Saros and you’ve deposited liquidity into the SOL/USDC pool, setting your range between $140 and $160 per SOL.
At the time of deposit, SOL is trading at $150, which means your liquidity is in range and actively earning trading fees from users swapping between SOL and USDC.
A few days later, Solana rallies due to strong market momentum, and the price of SOL climbs to $170 — pushing it outside of your selected range.
Your liquidity is now out of position, and you’ve stopped earning swap fees.
This is when you need to decide your next move — whether to wait, adjust your position, or take another route altogether.
If you’re okay with waiting, you can leave your position as-is.
Pros:
No need to pay gas or swap fees — Solana's low-cost network makes this option inexpensive
If the price of SOL returns to your original range, your position will automatically start earning fees again
Cons:
Your liquidity won’t earn fees while out of range
Your asset balance may become skewed (e.g., mostly USDC if SOL continues rising)
You can withdraw your current liquidity and redeploy it into a higher price range that reflects the new market trend. For example, you could move your range from $140–$160 to $160–$180.
Your liquidity becomes active again within the new range, allowing you to earn trading fees
You maintain exposure to SOL if you believe the price will continue upward
You’ll incur swap and transaction fees, though they’re relatively low on Solana
If the price reverses and drops back to the old range, you may need to reposition again, incurring additional costs and downtime.
If you’re not confident in the current range or want flexibility, you can choose to fully withdraw your liquidity.
You’re no longer exposed to impermanent loss
You regain full control of your assets and can reallocate to other opportunities
You’ll stop earning fees from the pool
Withdrawals may result in transaction costs and potential tax implications, depending on your jurisdiction
If you have extra capital, you can choose to provide additional liquidity at a new range (e.g., $160–$180) without removing your original position.
You can earn fees across multiple price bands, increasing your market coverage
Useful if you anticipate continued price volatility and want to diversify your range
Ties up more of your capital in liquidity provision
Increases overall exposure to market movements, which may not be ideal if SOL price falls sharply
Each approach comes with its own set of trade-offs, and the right decision ultimately depends on your market outlook, risk appetite, and goals as a liquidity provider. When evaluating your next move, consider key factors such as current market trends, Solana’s network fees, your tolerance for impermanent loss, and whether you prefer a passive or active management style. Thoughtful rebalancing can help you optimize performance while maintaining control over your capital.
Participating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:
Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices diverge
Smart contract vulnerabilities
Systemic or platform-related failures
Market volatility and liquidity crunches
Regulatory shifts
Human or operational errors
There are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose. If you're unsure, always seek advice from a qualified financial professional.

Monitor or AutomateExample StrategiesUnderstanding the RisksCopySAROS DLMMShapes and StrategiesSingle-Sided Liquidity Strategies on SarosIn most decentralized exchanges, providing liquidity requires contributing both tokens in a trading pair — for example, USDC and SOL. However, Saros DLMM model introduces a more flexible alternative: single-sided liquidity.With this strategy, you can provide liquidity using only one token, opening up a variety of advanced use cases. Whether you're looking to accumulate a token during price dips, take profits at higher levels, or maintain full exposure to one asset, single-sided strategies give you the tools to manage your capital more efficiently.This guide walks you through what single-sided liquidity means, how it works on Saros, and how to set it up — including both its advantages and trade-offs.What is Single-Sided Liquidity?Single-sided liquidity refers to the process of supplying only one token (e.g., just USDC or just SOL) to a liquidity pool on Saros. Unlike traditional AMMs, which require equal-value deposits of two tokens, Saros enables users to deploy liquidity into specific price bins — and you can choose to place liquidity exclusively on one side of the market.This is made possible by the DLMM’s bin-based model, which allows for concentrated and asymmetric liquidity placement.Placing a single side of liquidity using Saros DLMM, would typically give you a shape that looks like one of the below:ExampleImagine you're holding 500 USDC and want to use it to accumulate SOL — but only if the price drops. Instead of placing a market order or constantly monitoring charts, you can deploy your USDC into the SOL/USDC pool using a single-sided strategy.You select a price range below the current market (e.g., $120–$135 per SOL), deposit just your USDC, and let the protocol do the rest.If the market price of SOL falls into that range, your USDC will gradually convert into SOL — often with zero slippage and while earning trading fees from swaps in that bin.The reverse scenario also applies. If you're holding SOL and want to sell it for USDC at higher prices, you can deposit SOL on the upper price ranges and wait for your desired exit.Why Use Single-Sided Liquidity?Single-sided deployment is useful when:You have a bullish or bearish bias toward one tokenYou want to accumulate or exit a position gradually without triggering large price impactYou want to earn fees while waiting for your ideal trade to happenYou want to automate DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into or out of an assetAdvantages of Single-Sided StrategiesStay fully exposed to one asset: Maintain exposure to either the base or quote token without dilution or unintended asset shifts.Efficient DCA mechanism: Set ranges where your token gradually converts into the other asset as price moves.Zero slippage conversions: Swaps are routed through bins, enabling exact pricing without price impact.Earn passive fees: If your single-sided liquidity is in range, you still collect trading fees while awaiting execution.For example, if you have 100 USDC and want to buy SOL — but only if the price drops — you can deposit your USDC as single-sided liquidity into a lower price range in the SOL/USDC pool.If the market moves in your favor — meaning the price of SOL falls into your chosen range — your USDC will begin converting into SOL automatically, without any manual trades, slippage, or constant monitoring.Trade-Offs and ConsiderationsWhile powerful, single-sided liquidity also comes with some limitations:Lower fee exposure: Compared to two-sided liquidity, you're only exposed to trades that interact with your chosen price bins, limiting fee-earning opportunities.Asset volatility remains: You avoid impermanent loss from paired-asset divergence, but you’re still exposed to the market fluctuations of the single token you deposit.Requires active monitoring or automation: If your goal is token accumulation or exit, you may want to withdraw once the conversion happens — or use Limit Orders on Saros to automate the process.How to Deploy a Single-Sided Liquidity PositionDeploying single-sided liquidity on Saros is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:On the homepage select Pool on the header. Select the pool that you want to add liquidity.1. Choose Your Token and Input AmountSelect the token you want to deploy (e.g., USDC or SOL). Enter the desired amount in the input field. Leave the second token field empty.2. Select Your Liquidity ShapeChoose from the available Shapes:Spot for flat exposureCurve for gradual accumulationBid-Ask for directional positioningEach Shape is optimized for different market behaviors.3. Define Your Price RangeUse the slider or manual input to set your desired price range. To deploy a single-sided position:For USDC aiming to buy SOL, set your range below the current priceFor SOL aiming to sell into USDC, set your range above the current priceEnsure both ends of your price range fall on the same side of the active bin.4. Confirm and DeployReview your parameters and click “Deploy Liquidity.” Confirm the transaction in your connected wallet. On Solana, this is typically confirmed in seconds and with minimal fees.5. Monitor or AutomateOnce your liquidity is active:Track the status and composition of your positionSet up Limit Orders on Saros to automatically withdraw liquidity once a certain condition is met (e.g., full conversion to the desired token)Example StrategiesHere are a few common use cases you can implement on Saros:Accumulate SOL on dips: Deposit USDC into a lower price range (e.g., $115–$130) and wait for market actionTake profits into USDC: Deposit SOL into an upper range (e.g., $160–$180) if you expect a price pumpMarket-neutral entry strategy: If you're unsure about short-term direction, you can split capital into two separate single-sided positions — covering both a dip and a rallyUnderstanding the RisksParticipating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices divergeSmart contract vulnerabilitiesSystemic or platform-related failuresMarket volatility and liquidity crunchesRegulatory shiftsHuman or operational errorsThere are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose.

In most decentralized exchanges, providing liquidity requires contributing both tokens in a trading pair — for example, USDC and SOL. However, Saros DLMM model introduces a more flexible alternative: single-sided liquidity.
With this strategy, you can provide liquidity using only one token, opening up a variety of advanced use cases. Whether you're looking to accumulate a token during price dips, take profits at higher levels, or maintain full exposure to one asset, single-sided strategies give you the tools to manage your capital more efficiently.
This guide walks you through what single-sided liquidity means, how it works on Saros, and how to set it up — including both its advantages and trade-offs.
Single-sided liquidity refers to the process of supplying only one token (e.g., just USDC or just SOL) to a liquidity pool on Saros. Unlike traditional AMMs, which require equal-value deposits of two tokens, Saros enables users to deploy liquidity into specific price bins — and you can choose to place liquidity exclusively on one side of the market.
This is made possible by the DLMM’s bin-based model, which allows for concentrated and asymmetric liquidity placement.
Placing a single side of liquidity using Saros DLMM, would typically give you a shape that looks like one of the below:
Imagine you're holding 500 USDC and want to use it to accumulate SOL — but only if the price drops. Instead of placing a market order or constantly monitoring charts, you can deploy your USDC into the SOL/USDC pool using a single-sided strategy.
You select a price range below the current market (e.g., $120–$135 per SOL), deposit just your USDC, and let the protocol do the rest.
If the market price of SOL falls into that range, your USDC will gradually convert into SOL — often with zero slippage and while earning trading fees from swaps in that bin.
The reverse scenario also applies. If you're holding SOL and want to sell it for USDC at higher prices, you can deposit SOL on the upper price ranges and wait for your desired exit.
Single-sided deployment is useful when:
You have a bullish or bearish bias toward one token
You want to accumulate or exit a position gradually without triggering large price impact
You want to earn fees while waiting for your ideal trade to happen
You want to automate DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) into or out of an asset
Stay fully exposed to one asset: Maintain exposure to either the base or quote token without dilution or unintended asset shifts.
Efficient DCA mechanism: Set ranges where your token gradually converts into the other asset as price moves.
Zero slippage conversions: Swaps are routed through bins, enabling exact pricing without price impact.
Earn passive fees: If your single-sided liquidity is in range, you still collect trading fees while awaiting execution.
For example, if you have 100 USDC and want to buy SOL — but only if the price drops — you can deposit your USDC as single-sided liquidity into a lower price range in the SOL/USDC pool.
If the market moves in your favor — meaning the price of SOL falls into your chosen range — your USDC will begin converting into SOL automatically, without any manual trades, slippage, or constant monitoring.
While powerful, single-sided liquidity also comes with some limitations:
Lower fee exposure: Compared to two-sided liquidity, you're only exposed to trades that interact with your chosen price bins, limiting fee-earning opportunities.
Asset volatility remains: You avoid impermanent loss from paired-asset divergence, but you’re still exposed to the market fluctuations of the single token you deposit.
Requires active monitoring or automation: If your goal is token accumulation or exit, you may want to withdraw once the conversion happens — or use Limit Orders on Saros to automate the process.
Deploying single-sided liquidity on Saros is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:
On the homepage select Pool on the header. Select the pool that you want to add liquidity.
Select the token you want to deploy (e.g., USDC or SOL). Enter the desired amount in the input field. Leave the second token field empty.
Choose from the available Shapes:
Spot for flat exposure
Curve for gradual accumulation
Bid-Ask for directional positioning
Each Shape is optimized for different market behaviors.
Use the slider or manual input to set your desired price range. To deploy a single-sided position:
For USDC aiming to buy SOL, set your range below the current price
For SOL aiming to sell into USDC, set your range above the current price
Ensure both ends of your price range fall on the same side of the active bin.
Review your parameters and click “Deploy Liquidity.” Confirm the transaction in your connected wallet. On Solana, this is typically confirmed in seconds and with minimal fees.
Once your liquidity is active:
Track the status and composition of your position
Set up Limit Orders on Saros to automatically withdraw liquidity once a certain condition is met (e.g., full conversion to the desired token)
Here are a few common use cases you can implement on Saros:
Accumulate SOL on dips: Deposit USDC into a lower price range (e.g., $115–$130) and wait for market action
Take profits into USDC: Deposit SOL into an upper range (e.g., $160–$180) if you expect a price pump
Market-neutral entry strategy: If you're unsure about short-term direction, you can split capital into two separate single-sided positions — covering both a dip and a rally
Participating in liquidity provision—regardless of strategy—comes with inherent risks. These include, but are not limited to:
Impermanent Loss (IL) when asset prices diverge
Smart contract vulnerabilities
Systemic or platform-related failures
Market volatility and liquidity crunches
Regulatory shifts
Human or operational errors
There are no guarantees in DeFi, and you should only provide liquidity with capital you can afford to lose. If you're unsure, always seek advice from a qualified financial professional.

Concentrated Liquidity2. Liquidity BookLiquidity Book DesignProduct ArchitectureUser InteractionsImprovementsCopySAROS DLMMTechnical DesignIntroSaros DLMM runs on Liquidity Book (courtesy of LFJ).Liquidity Book core enables the creation of unique and dynamic liquidity structures for a paired asset market, as liquidity is pooled in constant price bins which are aggregated to establish a market.The mechanism makes it fast and seamless for anyone to trade directly on Solana - no middlemen, just pure DeFi power.1. Concentrated LiquidityUniswap v3 introduced concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate reserves within specific price ranges, aggregated via a constant function formula.Curve v1 and v2 similarly concentrate liquidity around a peg price, with v2 using a dynamic peg via an internal price oracle.In general, these constant function models limit tailored market-making strategies.2. Liquidity BookThe Liquidity Book (LB) organizes liquidity for an asset pair into discrete price bins, where deposited reserves are traded at each bin's fixed exchange rate. The market is formed by combining all these bins, with liquidity contributions from various participants.Liquidity Structure ExampleLet’s take a deeper look into the design.Liquidity Book Design1. Reserve PricingFollowing AMM convention, price (P) is defined as the rate of change in Y reserves per change in X reserves. Price represents the value of the base asset (X) denominated in the quote asset (Y) terms.2. Bin LiquidityLiquidity (L) is the nominal value of reserves in a discrete bin, denominated in the quoted asset, and conserved as reserve composition changes.
Liquidity (L) is defined to be the nominal value of reserves deposited into a discrete bin and is denominated in the quote asset. Liquidity is conserved as the bin’s reserve composition changes and can be described in Eq 2.2 as the value sum of its composite assets.Each bin operates as a constant sum market with a unique bonding curve, defined by a static price and dynamic liquidity reserves. The y-intercept in the figure below shows total liquidity (L), with the slope set by the bin’s price.Reserves Bonding Curve3. Bin CompositionThe reserve composition in a liquidity bin is independent of price and liquidity. A composition factor (c), defined as the percentage of bin liquidity held as Y reserves, describes available reserves and is bounded between 0 and 1.Asset reserves of each liquidity bin can be fully described by bin liquidity (L) and composition (c)4. Market AggregationCombining liquidity bins for an asset pair forms the market. As market prices shift, bin reserves transition between X and Y assets. Bins priced below the market hold only Y, while those above hold only X. The market price is set by the lowest-priced bin containing X reserves.Aggregate Liquidity Composition5. Market MakingDiscrete liquidity bins enable liquidity providers to tailor liquidity structures to their goals, predictions, and risk profiles. Providers can focus liquidity around specific price points or spreads and adjust individual bins without affecting others.The liquidity book design supports precise range and depth adjustments for effective market making.Product Architecture1. Market DefinitionThe market price range is limited to (2⁻¹²⁸, 2¹²⁸) and divided into bins based on a bin step (s).Smaller bin steps create more bins. A market is defined by the (X, Y, s) set. The total number of bins is 2*Nb, where Nb is the maximum number of bins between price parity and the maximum price for a given bin step.The maximum number of bins is capped below 2²⁴, with half assigned below and half above price parity. In a market with the maximum bins, the parity bin identifier is 2²³, denoted as constant b. Each bin receives a positive integer identifier (i) ranging from [b - Nb, b + Nb].2. Bin PriceThe price prescribed to each bin is a function of the pair’s bin step (s) and the bin’s identifier (i). The bin step parameter determines the constant percentage increase or decrease in price between each incremental bin.3. Liquidity TrackingLiquidity bins are indexed in a tree structure using three nested 256-bit arrays. Each bin is assigned a location path in the arrays, with non-zero values indicating bins containing liquidity.This tree enables efficient liquidity state searches during swaps and external monitoring.Bin Index Tree4. Trade RoutingThe LB router will provide added security and slippage checks for swaps and liquidity deposits/withdrawals. Swaps will also be routed through legacy AMM pairs when better pricing is found.5. Liquidity TokensThe LB protocol introduces LBToken, a new liquidity token standard tailored for its numerous bins. Liquidity (L) in LB markets is valued uniformly in Y terms, independent of bin state, making it composable across bins.6. Market ParametersEach market has fee rate parameters, detailed in next sections, initially set based on the chosen bin step. Markets can only be created with bin steps linked to predefined fee parameters in the factory. These parameters can be adjusted post-initialization7. OraclesSaros DLMM markets feature an oracle that logstimestampcumulativeIDcumulativeAccumulatorcumulativeBinCrossedThese cumulative values help track changes over time, providing market price and volatility/fee metrics for algorithmic trading and liquidity provision. The sampleLifetime, set at market creation, determines the sampling rate, and users can increase the oracle sample size as needed.User Interactions1. Add / Remove LiquidityAdding or removing liquidity from an active bin maintains the price (P) and composition (c). The required amounts of reserve X and Y for a liquidity adjustment.For all ‘inactive’ liquidity bins, liquidity can be added exclusively in reserve X or reserve Y as determined by the composition bounds.Liquidity added to an active bin is automatically swapped if it mismatches the bin’s composition, incurring a fee. Attempts to add liquidity to inactive bins that don’t align with the bin’s composition will fail.2. SwapsExchanging reserves in a liquidity bin preserves liquidity and price, altering only the reserve composition. Reserves are swapped, with composition staying within [0,1].The reserves that are available in the liquidity bin until the composition bounds are reached can be calculated:When a swap exceeds the liquidity in a bin, it depletes each consecutive bin’s liquidity before moving to the next adjacent bin with available liquidity.3. Swap feesThe protocol collects fees to reward liquidity providers for trading activity. The total swap fee (fs) includes a base fee (fb) and a variable fee (fv) based on price volatility.Fees are applied to the swap amount in each bin, distributed proportionally to providers after a protocol share, and held separately for providers to claim. The total fee for a swap across n bins is calculated:Base feeThe base fee represents the minimum rate for all swaps. The base fee rate (fb) is a function of the bin step (s) and is scaled by a baseFactor (B)Variable feeThe variable fee (fv) is designed to compensate liquidity providers for instantaneous volatility and incentivize liquidity providers to actively manage liquidity around a moving price. The variable fee is calculated per bin (k)Instantaneous volatility is tracked by the volatility accumulator variable (va). The variableFeeControl parameter (A) scales the variable fee component based on expected market dynamics.Volatility AccumulatorVolatility is based on bin changes over time, with each change reflecting a fixed price movement set by the bin step.A volatility accumulator (va) measures bin crossovers across transactions, using the number of crossovers (k), a reference bin index (ir), the starting active bin (ik=0), and a reference volatility value (vr)Where the reference values are calculated at the beginning of each transaction and depend on time elapsed since the last transaction (t)The volatility accumulator calculates the bin distance from the swap bin to a reference bin, adding a carryover volatility (vr). The reference bin updates to the current bin if no transactions occur for a period exceeding the filterPeriod (tf).Reference volatility updates based on transaction frequency, decaying by the reductionFactor R when time exceeds tf, or resetting to 0 when exceeding the decayPeriod (td). A maxAccumulator parameter (vmax) limits the accumulator to prevent excessive fees.4. Active Bin Composition FeeLiquidity added to the active bin is automatically swapped across reserves if its composition differs from the bin’s. The swap amount ensures the bin’s assets match those from a prior swap, incurring a fee similar to the current market swap fee.5. Protocol FeeA portion of swap fees, set by the protocolShare parameter, is retained by the protocol (fp). Each market has its own protocolShare to manage fee distribution. Remaining fees are distributed to liquidity providers.Improvements1. Impermanent Loss (IL)Variable fees compensate liquidity providers for IL caused by price volatility, with the volatility accumulator adjusting fees to market conditions. Providers can outperform expected payoffs due to the accumulator’s time decay, as shown in below figure.However, tracking errors occur during highly volatile events due to significant nominal price changes, as the accumulator relies on bin steps.Fee Adjusted Per IL2. Liquidity DepthEnhancing the DEX capital efficiency increases market depth for a given capital amount. Capital efficiency is the reduction in capital needed to match v1 liquidity.For Saros DLMM, equivalent liquidity aligns the price impact of a v1 swap with a single bin step. The efficiency equation is provided, with maximum efficiency limits for each market and bin step.Capital Efficiency LimitsFrom the above figure, capital efficiency is similar to Uniswap v3 (v3). An evenly distributed LB position approximates a v3 position.If liquidity is equally spread across bins in X tokens, the swap value difference between LB and v3 is calculated, and can be plotted for positions with varying price ranges and bin steps.Market Depth compared to Uni v3The figure shows that position price range impacts market depth more than bin structure.For positions spanning at least two bins, depth differences across bin steps are minimal. With the specified distribution, LB’s market depth is within 1% of Uniswap v3 for positions under a 60% price range.Depth differences, mainly due to liquidity distribution compared to v3’s geometric sequence, are only significant for large-range positions, highlighting the value of LB’s flexible liquidity distribution.PreviousConcentrated Incentives (CI) on SarosNextTechnical GuidesLast updated4 months ago

Market ParametersEach market has fee rate parameters, detailed in next sections, initially set based on the chosen bin step. Markets can only be created with bin steps linked to predefined fee parameters in the factory. These parameters can be adjusted post-initialization7. OraclesSaros DLMM markets feature an oracle that logstimestampcumulativeIDcumulativeAccumulatorcumulativeBinCrossedThese cumulative values help track changes over time, providing market price and volatility/fee metrics for algorithmic trading and liquidity provision. The sampleLifetime, set at market creation, determines the sampling rate, and users can increase the oracle sample size as needed.User Interactions1. Add / Remove LiquidityAdding or removing liquidity from an active bin maintains the price (P) and composition (c). The required amounts of reserve X and Y for a liquidity adjustment.For all ‘inactive’ liquidity bins, liquidity can be added exclusively in reserve X or reserve Y as determined by the composition bounds.Liquidity added to an active bin is automatically swapped if it mismatches the bin’s composition, incurring a fee. Attempts to add liquidity to inactive bins that don’t align with the bin’s composition will fail.2. SwapsExchanging reserves in a liquidity bin preserves liquidity and price, altering only the reserve composition. Reserves are swapped, with composition staying within [0,1].The reserves that are available in the liquidity bin until the composition bounds are reached can be calculated:When a swap exceeds the liquidity in a bin, it depletes each consecutive bin’s liquidity before moving to the next adjacent bin with available liquidity.3. Swap feesThe protocol collects fees to reward liquidity providers for trading activity. The total swap fee (fs) includes a base fee (fb) and a variable fee (fv) based on price volatility.Fees are applied to the swap amount in each bin, distributed proportionally to providers after a protocol share, and held separately for providers to claim. The total fee for a swap across n bins is calculated:Base feeThe base fee represents the minimum rate for all swaps. The base fee rate (fb) is a function of the bin step (s) and is scaled by a baseFactor (B)Variable feeThe variable fee (fv) is designed to compensate liquidity providers for instantaneous volatility and incentivize liquidity providers to actively manage liquidity around a moving price. The variable fee is calculated per bin (k)Instantaneous volatility is tracked by the volatility accumulator variable (va). The variableFeeControl parameter (A) scales the variable fee component based on expected market dynamics.Volatility AccumulatorVolatility is based on bin changes over time, with each change reflecting a fixed price movement set by the bin step.A volatility accumulator (va) measures bin crossovers across transactions, using the number of crossovers (k), a reference bin index (ir), the starting active bin (ik=0), and a reference volatility value (vr)Where the reference values are calculated at the beginning of each transaction and depend on time elapsed since the last transaction (t)The volatility accumulator calculates the bin distance from the swap bin to a reference bin, adding a carryover volatility (vr). The reference bin updates to the current bin if no transactions occur for a period exceeding the filterPeriod (tf).Reference volatility updates based on transaction frequency, decaying by the reductionFactor R when time exceeds tf, or resetting to 0 when exceeding the decayPeriod (td). A maxAccumulator parameter (vmax) limits the accumulator to prevent excessive fees.4. Active Bin Composition FeeLiquidity added to the active bin is automatically swapped across reserves if its composition differs from the bin’s. The swap amount ensures the bin’s assets match those from a prior swap, incurring a fee similar to the current market swap fee.5. Protocol FeeA portion of swap fees, set by the protocolShare parameter, is retained by the protocol (fp). Each market has its own protocolShare to manage fee distribution. Remaining fees are distributed to liquidity providers.Improvements1. Impermanent Loss (IL)Variable fees compensate liquidity providers for IL caused by price volatility, with the volatility accumulator adjusting fees to market conditions. Providers can outperform expected payoffs due to the accumulator’s time decay, as shown in below figure.However, tracking errors occur during highly volatile events due to significant nominal price changes, as the accumulator relies on bin steps.Fee Adjusted Per IL2. Liquidity DepthEnhancing the DEX capital efficiency increases market depth for a given capital amount. Capital efficiency is the reduction in capital needed to match v1 liquidity.For Saros DLMM, equivalent liquidity aligns the price impact of a v1 swap with a single bin step. The efficiency equation is provided, with maximum efficiency limits for each market and bin step.Capital Efficiency LimitsFrom the above figure, capital efficiency is similar to Uniswap v3 (v3). An evenly distributed LB position approximates a v3 position.If liquidity is equally spread across bins in X tokens, the swap value difference between LB and v3 is calculated, and can be plotted for positions with varying price ranges and bin steps.Market Depth compared to Uni v3The figure shows that position price range impacts market depth more than bin structure.For positions spanning at least two bins, depth differences across bin steps are minimal. With the specified distribution, LB’s market depth is within 1% of Uniswap v3 for positions under a 60% price range.Depth differences, mainly due to liquidity distribution compared to v3’s geometric sequence, are only significant for large-range positions, highlighting the value of LB’s flexible liquidity distribution.
Saros DLMM runs on Liquidity Book (courtesy of LFJ).
Liquidity Book core enables the creation of unique and dynamic liquidity structures for a paired asset market, as liquidity is pooled in constant price bins which are aggregated to establish a market.
The mechanism makes it fast and seamless for anyone to trade directly on Solana - no middlemen, just pure DeFi power.
Uniswap v3 introduced concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to allocate reserves within specific price ranges, aggregated via a constant function formula.
Curve v1 and v2 similarly concentrate liquidity around a peg price, with v2 using a dynamic peg via an internal price oracle.
In general, these constant function models limit tailored market-making strategies.
The Liquidity Book (LB) organizes liquidity for an asset pair into discrete price bins, where deposited reserves are traded at each bin's fixed exchange rate. The market is formed by combining all these bins, with liquidity contributions from various participants.
Liquidity Structure Example
Let’s take a deeper look into the design.
1. Reserve Pricing
Following AMM convention, price (P) is defined as the rate of change in Y reserves per change in X reserves. Price represents the value of the base asset (X) denominated in the quote asset (Y) terms.
2. Bin Liquidity
Liquidity (L) is the nominal value of reserves in a discrete bin, denominated in the quoted asset, and conserved as reserve composition changes.
Liquidity (L) is defined to be the nominal value of reserves deposited into a discrete bin and is denominated in the quote asset. Liquidity is conserved as the bin’s reserve composition changes and can be described in Eq 2.2 as the value sum of its composite assets.
Each bin operates as a constant sum market with a unique bonding curve, defined by a static price and dynamic liquidity reserves. The y-intercept in the figure below shows total liquidity (L), with the slope set by the bin’s price.
Reserves Bonding Curve
3. Bin Composition
The reserve composition in a liquidity bin is independent of price and liquidity. A composition factor (c), defined as the percentage of bin liquidity held as Y reserves, describes available reserves and is bounded between 0 and 1.
Asset reserves of each liquidity bin can be fully described by bin liquidity (L) and composition (c)
4. Market Aggregation
Combining liquidity bins for an asset pair forms the market. As market prices shift, bin reserves transition between X and Y assets. Bins priced below the market hold only Y, while those above hold only X. The market price is set by the lowest-priced bin containing X reserves.
Aggregate Liquidity Composition
5. Market Making
Discrete liquidity bins enable liquidity providers to tailor liquidity structures to their goals, predictions, and risk profiles. Providers can focus liquidity around specific price points or spreads and adjust individual bins without affecting others.
The liquidity book design supports precise range and depth adjustments for effective market making.
1. Market Definition
The market price range is limited to (2⁻¹²⁸, 2¹²⁸) and divided into bins based on a bin step (s).
Smaller bin steps create more bins. A market is defined by the (X, Y, s) set. The total number of bins is 2*Nb, where Nb is the maximum number of bins between price parity and the maximum price for a given bin step.
The maximum number of bins is capped below 2²⁴, with half assigned below and half above price parity. In a market with the maximum bins, the parity bin identifier is 2²³, denoted as constant b. Each bin receives a positive integer identifier (i) ranging from [b - Nb, b + Nb].
2. Bin Price
The price prescribed to each bin is a function of the pair’s bin step (s) and the bin’s identifier (i). The bin step parameter determines the constant percentage increase or decrease in price between each incremental bin.
3. Liquidity Tracking
Liquidity bins are indexed in a tree structure using three nested 256-bit arrays. Each bin is assigned a location path in the arrays, with non-zero values indicating bins containing liquidity.
This tree enables efficient liquidity state searches during swaps and external monitoring.
Bin Index Tree
4. Trade Routing
The LB router will provide added security and slippage checks for swaps and liquidity deposits/withdrawals. Swaps will also be routed through legacy AMM pairs when better pricing is found.
5. Liquidity Tokens
The LB protocol introduces LBToken, a new liquidity token standard tailored for its numerous bins. Liquidity (L) in LB markets is valued uniformly in Y terms, independent of bin state, making it composable across bins.
6. Market Parameters
Each market has fee rate parameters, detailed in next sections, initially set based on the chosen bin step. Markets can only be created with bin steps linked to predefined fee parameters in the factory. These parameters can be adjusted post-initialization
7. Oracles
Saros DLMM markets feature an oracle that logs
timestamp
cumulativeID
cumulativeAccumulator
cumulativeBinCrossed
These cumulative values help track changes over time, providing market price and volatility/fee metrics for algorithmic trading and liquidity provision. The sampleLifetime, set at market creation, determines the sampling rate, and users can increase the oracle sample size as needed.
1. Add / Remove Liquidity
Adding or removing liquidity from an active bin maintains the price (P) and composition (c). The required amounts of reserve X and Y for a liquidity adjustment.
For all ‘inactive’ liquidity bins, liquidity can be added exclusively in reserve X or reserve Y as determined by the composition bounds.
Liquidity added to an active bin is automatically swapped if it mismatches the bin’s composition, incurring a fee. Attempts to add liquidity to inactive bins that don’t align with the bin’s composition will fail.
2. Swaps
Exchanging reserves in a liquidity bin preserves liquidity and price, altering only the reserve composition. Reserves are swapped, with composition staying within [0,1].
The reserves that are available in the liquidity bin until the composition bounds are reached can be calculated:
When a swap exceeds the liquidity in a bin, it depletes each consecutive bin’s liquidity before moving to the next adjacent bin with available liquidity.
3. Swap fees
The protocol collects fees to reward liquidity providers for trading activity. The total swap fee (fs) includes a base fee (fb) and a variable fee (fv) based on price volatility.
Fees are applied to the swap amount in each bin, distributed proportionally to providers after a protocol share, and held separately for providers to claim. The total fee for a swap across n bins is calculated:
Base fee
The base fee represents the minimum rate for all swaps. The base fee rate (fb) is a function of the bin step (s) and is scaled by a baseFactor (B)
Variable fee
The variable fee (fv) is designed to compensate liquidity providers for instantaneous volatility and incentivize liquidity providers to actively manage liquidity around a moving price. The variable fee is calculated per bin (k)
Instantaneous volatility is tracked by the volatility accumulator variable (va). The variableFeeControl parameter (A) scales the variable fee component based on expected market dynamics.
Volatility Accumulator
Volatility is based on bin changes over time, with each change reflecting a fixed price movement set by the bin step.
A volatility accumulator (va) measures bin crossovers across transactions, using the number of crossovers (k), a reference bin index (ir), the starting active bin (ik=0), and a reference volatility value (vr)
Where the reference values are calculated at the beginning of each transaction and depend on time elapsed since the last transaction (t)
The volatility accumulator calculates the bin distance from the swap bin to a reference bin, adding a carryover volatility (vr). The reference bin updates to the current bin if no transactions occur for a period exceeding the filterPeriod (tf).
Reference volatility updates based on transaction frequency, decaying by the reductionFactor R when time exceeds tf, or resetting to 0 when exceeding the decayPeriod (td). A maxAccumulator parameter (vmax) limits the accumulator to prevent excessive fees.
4. Active Bin Composition Fee
Liquidity added to the active bin is automatically swapped across reserves if its composition differs from the bin’s. The swap amount ensures the bin’s assets match those from a prior swap, incurring a fee similar to the current market swap fee.
5. Protocol Fee
A portion of swap fees, set by the protocolShare parameter, is retained by the protocol (fp). Each market has its own protocolShare to manage fee distribution. Remaining fees are distributed to liquidity providers.
1. Impermanent Loss (IL)
Variable fees compensate liquidity providers for IL caused by price volatility, with the volatility accumulator adjusting fees to market conditions. Providers can outperform expected payoffs due to the accumulator’s time decay, as shown in below figure.
However, tracking errors occur during highly volatile events due to significant nominal price changes, as the accumulator relies on bin steps.
Fee Adjusted Per IL
2. Liquidity Depth
Enhancing the DEX capital efficiency increases market depth for a given capital amount. Capital efficiency is the reduction in capital needed to match v1 liquidity.
For Saros DLMM, equivalent liquidity aligns the price impact of a v1 swap with a single bin step. The efficiency equation is provided, with maximum efficiency limits for each market and bin step.
Capital Efficiency Limits
From the above figure, capital efficiency is similar to Uniswap v3 (v3). An evenly distributed LB position approximates a v3 position.
If liquidity is equally spread across bins in X tokens, the swap value difference between LB and v3 is calculated, and can be plotted for positions with varying price ranges and bin steps.
Market Depth compared to Uni v3
The figure shows that position price range impacts market depth more than bin structure.
For positions spanning at least two bins, depth differences across bin steps are minimal. With the specified distribution, LB’s market depth is within 1% of Uniswap v3 for positions under a 60% price range.
Depth differences, mainly due to liquidity distribution compared to v3’s geometric sequence, are only significant for large-range positions, highlighting the value of LB’s flexible liquidity distribution.

This walkthrough demonstrates how to inject liquidity into a Saros DLMM liquidity pool through your frontend integration. The two primary flows are:
Opening a new positionwhen none exists
Augmenting an existing position
Key steps in both flows:
Compute token amounts to deposit
Invoke the relevant on‑chain instruction
To create a new liquidity position, you'll need to:
Determine the bin range for the position by specifying relative bin IDs from the active bin:relative_bin_id_left: The leftmost bin ID relative to the active binrelative_bin_id_right: The rightmost bin ID relative to the active bin
Determine the bin range for the position by specifying relative bin IDs from the active bin:
relative_bin_id_left: The leftmost bin ID relative to the active bin
relative_bin_id_right: The rightmost bin ID relative to the active bin
Call thecreate_positioninstruction with these parameters
After creating the position, you can add liquidity using theincrease_positioninstruction

To add more liquidity to an existing position:
Calculate the amounts of tokens X and Y to add
Define the liquidity distribution across bins
Call theincrease_positioninstruction with:amountX: Amount of token X to addamountY: Amount of token Y to addliquidityDistribution: Array ofBinLiquidityDistributionobjects specifying how to distribute liquidity across bins
Call theincrease_positioninstruction with:
amountX: Amount of token X to add
amountY: Amount of token Y to add
liquidityDistribution: Array ofBinLiquidityDistributionobjects specifying how to distribute liquidity across bins
TheliquidityDistributionparameter is an array of objects with the following structure:
Copyinterface BinLiquidityDistribution {relativeBinId: number;    // Relative bin ID from active bindistributionX: number;    // Distribution of token X (0-10000)distributionY: number;    // Distribution of token Y (0-10000)}
interface BinLiquidityDistribution {
relativeBinId: number;    // Relative bin ID from active bin
distributionX: number;    // Distribution of token X (0-10000)
distributionY: number;    // Distribution of token Y (0-10000)
}
Notes:
The distribution values are in basis points (0-10000)
For bins with negative relative IDs, only token X can be distributed
For bins with positive relative IDs, only token Y can be distributed
The active bin (relativeBinId = 0) can receive both tokens
The sum of distributions should equal 10000 (100%)

This guide outlines how to establish a new token pair on a Saros DLMM pool via your frontend. The workflow is encapsulated in a single user transaction and includes:
Deriving required PDAs(Program Derived Addresses)
Creating the quote asset badge
Initializing the pool pair
Setting up the bin arrays
Before creating a pair, you need to derive several PDAs:
Copyimport { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";import { BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";import { utils } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";// Configuration PDAconst config = new PublicKey("address");// Token mintsconst tokenX = new PublicKey("address");const tokenY = new PublicKey("address");const BIN_STEP = 20;const BIN_ARRAY_INDEX = 0; // Example valueconst ACTIVE_ID = 8388608; // Example value (2^23)// Derive bin step config PDAconst [binStepConfig] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_step_config")),config.toBuffer(),new Uint8Array([BIN_STEP]),],program.programId);// Derive quote asset badge PDAconst [quoteAssetBadge] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("quote_asset_badge")),config.toBuffer(),tokenY.toBuffer(),],program.programId);// Derive pair PDAconst [pair] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("pair")),config.toBuffer(),tokenX.toBuffer(),tokenY.toBuffer(),new Uint8Array([BIN_STEP]),],program.programId);// Derive bin array PDAsconst [binArrayLower] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_array")),pair.toBuffer(),new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),],program.programId);const [binArrayUpper] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_array")),pair.toBuffer(),new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),],program.programId);
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { utils } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
// Configuration PDA
const config = new PublicKey("address");
// Token mints
const tokenX = new PublicKey("address");
const tokenY = new PublicKey("address");
const BIN_STEP = 20;
const BIN_ARRAY_INDEX = 0; // Example value
const ACTIVE_ID = 8388608; // Example value (2^23)
// Derive bin step config PDA
const [binStepConfig] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
[
Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_step_config")),
config.toBuffer(),
new Uint8Array([BIN_STEP]),
],
program.programId
);
// Derive quote asset badge PDA
const [quoteAssetBadge] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("quote_asset_badge")),
tokenY.toBuffer(),
// Derive pair PDA
const [pair] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("pair")),
tokenX.toBuffer(),
// Derive bin array PDAs
const [binArrayLower] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_array")),
pair.toBuffer(),
new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),
const [binArrayUpper] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),
For the pair to function, you need to create token vaults for both tokens:
Copyimport { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";// Create token vaults for the pairconst pairVaultX = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(connection,wallet.payer,tokenX,pair,true);const pairVaultY = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(connection,wallet.payer,tokenY,pair,true);
import { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";
// Create token vaults for the pair
const pairVaultX = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
connection,
wallet.payer,
tokenX,
pair,
true
const pairVaultY = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
tokenY,
The quote asset badge identifies which token is the quote asset (token Y):
Copy// Initialize quote asset badgeawait program.methods.initializeQuoteAssetBadge().accounts({quoteAssetBadge: quoteAssetBadge,liquidityBookConfig: config,tokenMint: tokenY,presetAuthority: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();
// Initialize quote asset badge
await program.methods
.initializeQuoteAssetBadge()
.accounts({
quoteAssetBadge: quoteAssetBadge,
liquidityBookConfig: config,
tokenMint: tokenY,
presetAuthority: wallet.publicKey,
})
.signers([wallet.payer])
.rpc();
Now you can initialize the pair with the specified active binitializeConfigD:
Copy// Initialize pairawait program.methods.initializePair(new BN(ACTIVE_ID)).accounts({liquidityBookConfig: config,binStepConfig: binStepConfig,quoteAssetBadge: quoteAssetBadge,pair: pair,tokenMintX: tokenX,tokenMintY: tokenY,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();
// Initialize pair
.initializePair(new BN(ACTIVE_ID))
binStepConfig: binStepConfig,
pair: pair,
tokenMintX: tokenX,
tokenMintY: tokenY,
user: wallet.publicKey,
Finally, you need to initialize the bin arrays for the pair:
Copy// Initialize lower bin arrayawait program.methods.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX)).accounts({pair: pair,binArray: binArrayLower,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();// Initialize upper bin arrayawait program.methods.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1)).accounts({pair: pair,binArray: binArrayUpper,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();
// Initialize lower bin array
.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX))
binArray: binArrayLower,
// Initialize upper bin array
.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1))
binArray: binArrayUpper,
Below is a consolidated script that ties together all the preceding steps:
Copyimport { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";import { BN, Program, utils } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";import { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";// Configurationconst config = new PublicKey("9aXo79uWCtxxxmssuTmAjCSGyP1sMxhQZdKZhrcMxGzz");const tokenX = new PublicKey("FtJADTW8HSB4t6QQ4WsR8kcrrZ6oVaoVJk7KEWQZDJqt");const tokenY = new PublicKey("Chc7CkBPvBsyNAmxAcupVox6pB5wcU2yuXD5PJAqQteb");const BIN_STEP = 20;const BIN_ARRAY_INDEX = 0;const ACTIVE_ID = 8388608;// Derive PDAsconst [binStepConfig] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_step_config")),config.toBuffer(),new Uint8Array([BIN_STEP]),],program.programId);const [quoteAssetBadge] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("quote_asset_badge")),config.toBuffer(),tokenY.toBuffer(),],program.programId);const [pair] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("pair")),config.toBuffer(),tokenX.toBuffer(),tokenY.toBuffer(),new Uint8Array([BIN_STEP]),],program.programId);const [binArrayLower] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_array")),pair.toBuffer(),new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),],program.programId);const [binArrayUpper] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from(utils.bytes.utf8.encode("bin_array")),pair.toBuffer(),new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 4),],program.programId);// Create token vaultsconst pairVaultX = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(connection,wallet.payer,tokenX,pair,true);const pairVaultY = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(connection,wallet.payer,tokenY,pair,true);// Initialize quote asset badgeawait program.methods.initializeQuoteAssetBadge().accounts({quoteAssetBadge: quoteAssetBadge,liquidityBookConfig: config,tokenMint: tokenY,presetAuthority: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();// Initialize pairawait program.methods.initializePair(new BN(ACTIVE_ID)).accounts({liquidityBookConfig: config,binStepConfig: binStepConfig,quoteAssetBadge: quoteAssetBadge,pair: pair,tokenMintX: tokenX,tokenMintY: tokenY,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();// Initialize bin arraysawait program.methods.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX)).accounts({pair: pair,binArray: binArrayLower,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();await program.methods.initializeBinArray(new BN(BIN_ARRAY_INDEX + 1)).accounts({pair: pair,binArray: binArrayUpper,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();console.log("Pair created successfully!");console.log("Pair address:", pair.toBase58());console.log("Bin array lower address:", binArrayLower.toBase58());console.log("Bin array upper address:", binArrayUpper.toBase58());

This guide details how to pull liquidity from a Saros DLMM pool via your frontend. You can either partially decrease an existing position or close it entirely in one transaction.
Key steps:
Calculating the shares to remove
Calling the appropriate instruction
To remove some liquidity from an existing position:
Calculate the shares to remove from each bin
Call thedecrease_positioninstruction with these parameters
Example Code
Copyimport { PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";import { BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";import { TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } from "@solana/spl-token";// Define the shares to remove from each bin// The number of shares must match the position width (upper_bin_id - lower_bin_id + 1)const sharesToRemove = [new BN(100000), // Shares to remove from bin 1new BN(200000), // Shares to remove from bin 2new BN(300000), // Shares to remove from bin 3// ... and so on for each bin in the position];// Derive bin array PDAsconst [binArrayLowerPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([0])],program.programId);const [binArrayUpperPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([1])],program.programId);await program.methods.decreasePosition(sharesToRemove).accounts({pair: pairPda,position: positionPda,binArrayLower: binArrayLowerPda,binArrayUpper: binArrayUpperPda,tokenMintX: tokenMintX,tokenMintY: tokenMintY,tokenVaultX: tokenVaultXPda,tokenVaultY: tokenVaultYPda,userVaultX: userVaultXPda,userVaultY: userVaultYPda,positionTokenAccount: positionTokenAccount,tokenProgramX: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,tokenProgramY: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,positionTokenProgram: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();​
import { PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } from "@solana/spl-token";
// Define the shares to remove from each bin
// The number of shares must match the position width (upper_bin_id - lower_bin_id + 1)
const sharesToRemove = [
new BN(100000), // Shares to remove from bin 1
new BN(200000), // Shares to remove from bin 2
new BN(300000), // Shares to remove from bin 3
// ... and so on for each bin in the position
];
// Derive bin array PDAs
const [binArrayLowerPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
[Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([0])],
program.programId
);
const [binArrayUpperPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
[Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([1])],
await program.methods
.decreasePosition(sharesToRemove)
.accounts({
pair: pairPda,
position: positionPda,
binArrayLower: binArrayLowerPda,
binArrayUpper: binArrayUpperPda,
tokenMintX: tokenMintX,
tokenMintY: tokenMintY,

tokenProgramY: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
positionTokenProgram: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
user: wallet.publicKey,
})
.signers([wallet.payer])
.rpc();
​
To completely close a position and remove all liquidity:
Call theclose_positioninstruction
Copyimport { PublicKey, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";import { TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } from "@solana/spl-token";// Derive bin array PDAsconst [binArrayLowerPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([0])],program.programId);const [binArrayUpperPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from("bin_array"), pairPda.toBuffer(), Buffer.from([1])],program.programId);await program.methods.closePosition().accounts({pair: pairPda,position: positionPda,binArrayLower: binArrayLowerPda,binArrayUpper: binArrayUpperPda,tokenMintX: tokenMintX,tokenMintY: tokenMintY,tokenVaultX: tokenVaultXPda,tokenVaultY: tokenVaultYPda,userVaultX: userVaultXPda,userVaultY: userVaultYPda,positionTokenAccount: positionTokenAccount,tokenProgramX: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,tokenProgramY: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,positionTokenProgram: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,user: wallet.publicKey,}).signers([wallet.payer]).rpc();​
.closePosition()
When decreasing a position, you need to specify the number of shares to remove from each bin. The number of shares must match the position width (upper_bin_id - lower_bin_id + 1).
You can calculate the shares to remove based on:
The percentage of liquidity you want to remove
The current liquidity in each bin
Example Calculation
Copy// Calculate shares to remove based on percentageconst calculateSharesToRemove = (position, percentageToRemove) => {const positionWidth = position.upper_bin_id - position.lower_bin_id + 1;const sharesToRemove = [];for (let i = 0; i < positionWidth; i++) {const currentShares = position.liquidity_shares[i];const sharesToRemoveFromBin = currentShares.mul(new BN(percentageToRemove)).div(new BN(10000));sharesToRemove.push(sharesToRemoveFromBin);}return sharesToRemove;};// Example: Remove 50% of liquidity from a positionconst sharesToRemove = calculateSharesToRemove(position, 5000);
// Calculate shares to remove based on percentage
const calculateSharesToRemove = (position, percentageToRemove) => {
const positionWidth = position.upper_bin_id - position.lower_bin_id + 1;
const sharesToRemove = [];
for (let i = 0; i < positionWidth; i++) {
const currentShares = position.liquidity_shares[i];
const sharesToRemoveFromBin = currentShares.mul(new BN(percentageToRemove)).div(new BN(10000));
sharesToRemove.push(sharesToRemoveFromBin);
}
return sharesToRemove;
};
// Example: Remove 50% of liquidity from a position
const sharesToRemove = calculateSharesToRemove(position, 5000);
width: number of bins in the position
liquidity_shares: existing shares per bin
percentageToRemove: e.g. 5000 = 50%

There are two types of swaps available:
Exact Input: You specify the exact amount of tokens you want to swap in, and receive the corresponding amount of tokens out
Exact Output: You specify the exact amount of tokens you want to receive, and provide the corresponding amount of tokens in
Swaps can be performed in two directions:
Swap for Y: Swap token X for token Y
Swap for X: Swap token Y for token X

const swapForY = false;
.swap(amountOut, otherAmountThreshold, swapForY, { exactOutput: {} })
When you perform a swap, the following happens:
Tokens are transferred from user to the pool's vault
The swap is executed across one or more bins, starting from the active bin
If the swap cannot be completed in a single bin, the active bin is moved and the swap continues
Tokens are transferred from the pool's vault to user
Protocol fees are collected and stored in the pair account

Remove your current liquidityGo to your pool page onSaros DLMM.Withdraw all existing liquidity from the wrongly priced bins.This ensures your tokens are safe from arbitrage while you reset2. Find the correct bin for 466.62 SAROS/SOLIn the pool UI, look for theAdd Liquiditysection.Use theBin Selector to navigate until the active bin price is≈ 466.62 SAROS/SOL.If your pool uses bin step inbps,remember:Smaller bin step → finer price incrementsLarger bin step → coarser jumps, so you might get 466.60 or 466.63, which is fine.3. Set your liquidity range around the target priceIf you want active liquidity:Choose a rangecentered on 466.62so your bin is active and earns fees.If you want passive liquidity:Choose a range slightlywiderso your position stays in range longer, even with price fluctuation.4. Add liquidity only after the active bin is correctDouble-check:Active bin price ≈ 466.62 SAROS/SOLLiquidity amounts match your intended token allocationClickConfirmto add liquidity.5. Monitor for driftPrices in DLMM can drift if a big swap moves bins.Periodically check if your active bin is still close to the market price.If not, repeat this process or adjust range.💡 Why this works:
Instead of trying to “force” the price via swaps (which in your case would drain ~94% of the SOL liquidity), you simply withdraw, reset, and re-add liquidity at the correct bin — avoiding big slippage losses.Mechanism when you do this (Real Example)The pool is currently mispricedPool price: 1 SOL = 650 SAROSMarket price: 1 SOL = 450 SAROSThis means SAROS isovervaluedin the pool → you need to add more SAROS to the pool or remove SOL to rebalance.You buy SAROS on the market (at the correct price)Buy 2,500 SAROS on DEXs/CEXs at around 450 SAROS/SOL.This SAROS amount is then injected into the pool.Add SAROS into the pool (via swap or one-sided liquidity)If you swapSAROS → get SOL, you push SAROS’s price down, moving the active bin closer to the market price.If youadd one-sided liquidity into the mispriced bin:- The DLMM will rebalance the SOL/SAROS amounts in that bin.- But if you add only one token, you’re effectively “creating” an imbalance, and others can arbitrage it immediately.Major risks with this approachImmediate arbitrage: If you inject SAROS into the pool but don’t fully align the price, arbitrage bots will instantly take the surplus SAROS for cheap SOL.Not a complete fix: 2,500 SAROS may be too small for a big gap (650 → 450), so the price may still be off and only slightly improved.Double loss:You pay for SAROS on the open market and also lose some SAROS to arbitrage if the pricing isn’t fully corrected.PreviousSaros DLMM Fees: Base Fee, Variable Fee & Protocol FeeNextSarosSwapLast updated1 month ago

DLMMprices are determined by theactive bin(the bin representing the current price).
If the active bin deviates more than 5% from the market price (here:640.96678 SAROS/SOLvs. market price466.615661 SAROS/SOL), it creates anarbitrage opportunity:
Arbitrageurs can buy low/sell high from your pool.
As an LP, you will take an immediate loss when adding liquidity.
Adjust the active bin back to the market price before adding liquidity
Remove all existing liquidity.
Reposition or “move” your liquidity to the bin step where the price is ~466.615 SAROS/SOL.
In the Saros DLMM UI, you can select a new Price Range or set the Active Bin close to the market price.
Perform a small swap to push the pool price back to the market price
If you control the pool or have enough capital, swap a small amount of tokens to shift the active bin toward the market price.
This method is quick but requires careful calculation to avoid losing on swap fees.
Remove and recreate the pool (for large deviations or low-liquidity new pools)
Use this if you can’t correct the price efficiently via swaps or bin adjustments.
When creating the new pool, set the initial price as close as possible to the market price.
NotesDo not add liquidity when the pool price is off, LPs will lose instantly when arbitrage happens.Always cross-check the market price on multiple sources (DEXs + major CEXs).To prevent large price deviations in the future:Choose a suitable bin step.Set up monitoring and rebalance periodically.Be extra cautious with low-liquidity pools, as a single large swap can move the price significantly.

With82 SOLand125 SAROS currently in the pool, moving the price from640.97 to466.62 SAROS/SOL (under a simple constant-product assumption) would requireremoving ~77.31 SOLfrom the pool which isn’t realistic, since that’s almost the entire SOL liquidity.
This means the pool isextremely unbalanced, and in practice:
A huge arbitrage opportunity exists, traders could drain the pool cheaply until the price realigns with the market.
The quickest fix isn’t a swap but resetting the active bin/liquidity position to the correct price level (via pool management or recreating the pool).
Alright, here's how you canreposition the active bin in Saros DLMMso it matches the target market price(466.62 SAROS/SOL)without draining your SOL liquidity.
1. Remove your current liquidity
Go to your pool page onSaros DLMM.
Withdraw all existing liquidity from the wrongly priced bins.
This ensures your tokens are safe from arbitrage while you reset
2. Find the correct bin for 466.62 SAROS/SOL
In the pool UI, look for theAdd Liquiditysection.
Use theBin Selector to navigate until the active bin price is≈ 466.62 SAROS/SOL.
If your pool uses bin step inbps,remember:Smaller bin step → finer price incrementsLarger bin step → coarser jumps, so you might get 466.60 or 466.63, which is fine.
If your pool uses bin step inbps,remember:
Smaller bin step → finer price increments
Larger bin step → coarser jumps, so you might get 466.60 or 466.63, which is fine.
3. Set your liquidity range around the target price
If you want active liquidity:Choose a rangecentered on 466.62so your bin is active and earns fees.
If you want passive liquidity:Choose a range slightlywiderso your position stays in range longer, even with price fluctuation.
4. Add liquidity only after the active bin is correct
Double-check:
Active bin price ≈ 466.62 SAROS/SOL
Liquidity amounts match your intended token allocation
ClickConfirmto add liquidity.
5. Monitor for drift
Prices in DLMM can drift if a big swap moves bins.
Periodically check if your active bin is still close to the market price.
If not, repeat this process or adjust range.
💡 Why this works:
Instead of trying to “force” the price via swaps (which in your case would drain ~94% of the SOL liquidity), you simply withdraw, reset, and re-add liquidity at the correct bin — avoiding big slippage losses.
The pool is currently mispriced
Pool price: 1 SOL = 650 SAROS
Market price: 1 SOL = 450 SAROS
This means SAROS isovervaluedin the pool → you need to add more SAROS to the pool or remove SOL to rebalance.
You buy SAROS on the market (at the correct price)
Buy 2,500 SAROS on DEXs/CEXs at around 450 SAROS/SOL.
This SAROS amount is then injected into the pool.
Add SAROS into the pool (via swap or one-sided liquidity)
If you swapSAROS → get SOL, you push SAROS’s price down, moving the active bin closer to the market price.
If youadd one-sided liquidity into the mispriced bin:
- The DLMM will rebalance the SOL/SAROS amounts in that bin.
- But if you add only one token, you’re effectively “creating” an imbalance, and others can arbitrage it immediately.
Immediate arbitrage: If you inject SAROS into the pool but don’t fully align the price, arbitrage bots will instantly take the surplus SAROS for cheap SOL.
Not a complete fix: 2,500 SAROS may be too small for a big gap (650 → 450), so the price may still be off and only slightly improved.Double loss:You pay for SAROS on the open market and also lose some SAROS to arbitrage if the pricing isn’t fully corrected.

This step-by-step guide will help you navigate the swap process seamlessly.Set up Solana WalletAt the moment, you can connect to Saros Swap using Coin98 Super Wallet.You need to download and set up a Multichain or Solana wallet to use Swap featureKindly refer to thisguide on download and set up Coin98 Super WalletGas fee and SPL standardIt should be noted that Saros Swap is on the Solananetwork, which means that you can only swap tokens in SPL standard.Saros SwapusesSOL (SPL standard)as transaction fees. Therefore, you should prepare SOL before any swaps on Saros.--> Everything is ready, let’s start.How to swapStep 1:Access the Saros Swap viahttps://saros.xyz/swapStep 2:Click onConnect Walletat the top right corner and choose your wallet provider then proceed to connect.For example, we will choose Coin98 wallet and connect.Step 3:Select the token you want to trade from the list and enter the amount you want to swapThis example will show the USDC/SAROS pair.Step 4:Check the amount of token you will receive and the transaction parameter details carefully to ensure it meets your expectations[1]Slippage: you can access the Settings on the top right corner to adjust the slippage and turn on/off safe mode.[2]Price impact and other parameters that may affect your transaction.Note:Swaps with a price impact greater than 5% are restricted whileSafe Modeis enabled. To proceed, please disableSafe Modein theSettings. Disabling Safe Mode allows high-impact trades, which may result in losses — proceed at your own risk.A higher slippage tolerance means you're willing to accept greater price deviation to ensure the transaction goes through, especially during market volatility or when liquidity is low.Saros integrates with the OKX DEX Aggregator, which supports routing through both Saros AMM and Saros DLMM pools to optimize pricing and minimize slippage.Note:Make sure you have enough SOL left for the gas feeStep 5:Click theSwapbutton and confirm the verification signature request.Note: Make sure to review the information and ensure you trust the website before confirming.Once confirmed, the transaction will be executed on the blockchain and when it completes, your tokens will appear in your wallet.
